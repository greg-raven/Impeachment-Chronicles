People are calling this protest the No Kings Day because Trump thinks he's a [...] king and you know he's not. He's barely a president. In fact, guess what? I'm going to say something that's going to get me in trouble. I don't think he won in a free and fair election. You heard me. I'm coming out and saying it myself. I don't care if that means I look crazy. Elon Musk [...] is good friends with Trump and at one point, I don't know if you remember, but he was giving out million-dollar checks to people if they would vote for Trump. That's illegal. It's unconstitutional and illegal. So, that was happening. And the fact that Trump won all seven swing states, which has never happened in the history of the US, makes it all very suspicious to me. So there I said it.

MAGA, has Trump done one damn thing for you?

MAGA, you were promised peace, a golden age of prosperity, security and an end to inflation.

Instead you have seen cuts in healthcare, SNAP benefits, veteran's benefits and Aid to Dependent Children, Cuts in education and all manner of vital social services and protections against the ravages of big business and banks and credit card companies. The elimination of overtime pay, workplace protection and pension and voting rights.

And the onslaught continues as you read these words.

Meanwhile Musk has received another 100-million-dollar contract for electric, armored trucks, to be used on the battlefield. Electric --- battlefield --- double A or extension cord?

Trump, too, is lining his pockets at your expense. While every one of you who have invested in his meme coin lost 75% of your money, he and his crime family raked in 100 million dollars in fees.

How prosperous are you feeling now, MAGA?

He sure is socking it to the libs.

By the hour, Donald Trump Elon Musk and his enablers Advance their extremist anti-equity un-American agenda dismantling Decades of civil rights progress upending livelihoods incomes and lives and and adversely affecting something they claim to care about the GDP um because all data supports that diversity equity and inclusion is actually good business Governor Reynolds my Republican colleagues invited you here today to promote what they see as a model of governance simply put Republicans vision of America is to be more like Iowa governor Reynolds let's learn more about the state do you know what percentage of winds are white and what percentage are black

I don't know the exact percentages now we're by far U larger percentage of white population

that's correct Iowa is 90% white and only four and a half% black so that is drastically different from the national population. So when Republicans suggest Iowa should be a national model they're advocating for a government that doesn't reflect our country um because all data supports that diversity equity and inclusion is actually good business.

I do believe that fear is truly warranted in the sense that people of color are just going to be rounded up I mean this is this I mean we've we've lived it especially as Black Folk in this country right like it's the racial profiling and so whether you're a U.S. citizen whether you are here as a doca recipient whether you are undocumented whether you are naturalized whatever your situation is I think that if you can be mistaken for being a brown person that you should be concerned because there is nothing that is tatted on anybody's head that says I'm undocumented or I'm a citizen right?

Jasmine Crockett: I'm trying to figure out exactly what it is that the Republicans believe our job is because right now they have relinquished their constitutional duties over to an unelected bureaucrat someone who no one went out to vote for absolutely he is occupying uh the Oval Office as we saw yesterday and that is a first for me to see someone occupying the Oval Office who's never actually been elected to the Oval Office and and actually answering more questions than the person that allegedly got elected.

Lawrence O'Donnell: We now have the first mug shot ever taken of a former president of the United States here is Donald Trump's mugshot which will instantly become the most famous mugshot in the history of photography the mugshot of the 45th president of the United States will go from tomorrow's newspapers into two our history books where the only presidential mugshot will live forever American High School history students will be looking at that photograph for hundreds of years that mugshot will Define the low point in the history of the American presidency that mugshot will soon be everywhere in our lives it will be on t-shirts coffee mugs napkins toilet pap paper this Christmas you will see people give and receive gifts with that mug shot on them artists will create their own Andy Warhol like Renditions of that mugshot hundreds of years from now history students around the world will be staring at that mug shot, staring into the eyes of Donald Trump and wondering what they see. What they should see is fear; Donald Trump's fear of what can happen in a country where no one is above the law. What they should see is stupidity; The stupidity that made Donald Trump a criminal defendant. And they should see hatred; Donald Trump's hatred of the Integrity of the institutions and the people who forced him to endure the humiliation of that mug shot.

Lindsey Graham: I'm not going to try to get into the mind of Donald Trump I think he's a cook I think he's crazy I think he's unfit for office and I'm a Republican and he's not.



Time will tell if Jussie's attackers shouted MAGA or not but there is no part of me that doubts that Trump and MAGA culture have encouraged and emboldened these types of attacks and that is truly fucking unforgivable. Billy Eichner, 1/29/19 xweet (see Sanctuary site)
