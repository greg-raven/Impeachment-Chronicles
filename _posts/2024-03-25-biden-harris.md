***Biden-Harris 2024 Spokesperson James Singer** released the following statement on Trump's press conference this afternoon:*

> Donald Trump is weak and desperate --- both as a man and a candidate for President.
>
> He spent the weekend golfing, the morning comparing himself to Jesus, and the aftermoon lying about having money he definitely doesn't have.
>
> His campaign can't raise money, he is uninterested in campaigning outside his country club, and every time he opens his mouth, he pushes moderate and suburban voters away with his dangerous agenda.
>
> America deserves better than a feeble, confused, and tired Donald Trump.
