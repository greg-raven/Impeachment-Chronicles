According to the Supreme Court, Biden could now send in Seal Team 6 to take all of them out. He could send in the military to take out Trump. He has "immunity" for official acts now!

All of these MAGA lunatics are saying that this is suggesting violence when the first 5 words are "according to the Supreme Court ..." 

Also, this is in reference to Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent which included this exactly

> When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority's reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy's Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.
