Washington --- President Biden's age was back in the news last week, thanks mostly to a front-page article in the Wall Street Journal announcing: "Behind closed doors, Biden shows signs of slipping."

\[...\]

The media have a part to play by taking more hard looks at both candidates --- beginning, perhaps, with a *Wall Street Journal* story on Trump.

The problem is not that we have an elderly president who's less crisp and coherent than he used to be. It's that we have two elderly candidates, both of whom are less crisp and coherent than they used to be.

One is unsteady on his feet. The other is a serial liar who thinks the Constitution allows him to overthrow elections and jail his opponents.
