The lies were so off the charts last night by Kamala Harris that CBS is fact checking her on TikTok.

> **Misleading**
>
> **Vice President Kamala Harris:**
>
> "He doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt."
>
> **Fact check:**
>
> - Former President Donald Trump has proposed broad-based tax cuts during his presidential campaign, extending beyond just high earners.
>
> - Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 that permanently cut corporate tax rates and lowered individual tax rates for most households.
>
> - Estimates from the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center found that the majority of people would benefit from these tax cuts.
>
> - Trump has said he will extend the individual tax rate cuts before are set to expire in 2025, a move the Congressional Budget Office estimates could cost $4.6 trillion over the next decade.
>
> - The Biden-Harris administration has proposed extending some of the Trump-era tax cuts for families earning under $400,000 annually.
>
> - Trump has also called for other tax cuts, including eliminating 16.1K taxes on tips, a policy proposal also backed by Harris campaign.

> **Vice President Kamala Harris:**
>
> "We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare."
>
> **Fact check:**
>
> During his presidency, former President Donald Trump proposed budgets that sought to reduce Medicare spending, prompting criticism from Democrats. In 2020, White House budget officials defended the proposed changes as "good government reforms," insisting that Medicare funding would continue to grow and that beneficiaries would not be directly affected --- a view echoed by independent budget watchdogs. Trump did not propose changes to Social Security retirement or survivor benefits, but did seek savings from the Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income.

> **Vice President Kamala Harris:**
>
> "We know what a second Trump term will look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisors."
>
> **Fact check:**
>
> Vice President Kamala Harris repeated a claim made by dozens of speakers at the Democratic National Convention that former President Donald Trump is responsible for or will follow Project 2025, a multi-pronged initiative offering policy recommendations for the next conservative president. It was led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
>
> Dozens of former Trump administration officials contributed to Project 2025, and CBS News identified at least 270 proposals out of 700 in their published blueprint that match Trump's past policies and current campaign promises.
>
> However, former President Donald Trump has not adopted the blur as his campaign platform and has attempted to distance himself from. In July, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, "I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're sayin are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal."
>
> Later, organizers behind Project 2025 said in a statement: "Project 2025 does not speak for any candidate or campaign."
