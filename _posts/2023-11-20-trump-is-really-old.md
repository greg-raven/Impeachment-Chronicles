Donald Trump is an old man.

He's 77 years old. When Trump was born, Harry S. Truman was president and Perry Como topped the year's pop charts. Betty White hadn't yet started her career in film. Israel and Pakistan didn't exist. Korea was a unified country, and Vietnam was not. The pioneering computer ENIAC was just four months old.

Trump's cultural references are dated, and only getting more so. Elton John and the Rolling Stones headline his rally playlists. When, as president, he had a chance to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, his selections included Babe Ruth (who died in 1948) and Elvis (who died in 1977â€”perhaps).

The same goes for his political touchstones. His view of immigration, in which foreign countries dispatch their undesirables en masse, seems to be shaped largely by the 1980 Mariel boatlift. His trade policy is steeped in '80s-era fears of Japan. He rails against "Communists" and "Marxists" like a Cold Warrior of yore (only with a peculiar affection for the Russians, rather than enmity).
