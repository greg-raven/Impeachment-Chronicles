Congressional Republicans released an interim report Wednesday accusing intelligence officials of embarking on a “political operation to help elect Vice President Biden in the 2020” election.

The 64-page report outlines information congressional Republicans have gathered about the letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials to cast doubt on the authenticity of the Hunter Biden laptop in the run-up to the 2020 election.

The report is titled “The Hunter Biden Statement: How Senior Intelligence Community Officials and the Biden Campaign Worked to Mislead American Voters.” It was authored by members of the GOP-led Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government and the House Intelligence Committee.

Chief among the new revelations is a claim from David Cariens, a former intelligence analyst for the CIA, that he only signed onto the letter after a member of the CIA’s Prepublication Classification Review Board asked him to.

Cariens recalled his memoir was undergoing review and that an intelligence official approached him about the then-draft letter.

“When the person in charge of reviewing the book called to say it was approved with no changes, I was told about the draft letter,” he told Republican investigators in a statement, per the report. “After hearing the letter’s contents, and the qualifiers … I agreed to sign.”

PCRB also “reviewed and approved” the statement prior to its release, according to a summary of the report. The letter came in response to a bombshell New York Post report about the younger Biden’s laptop and came at a time of heightened concerns of Russian meddling in the election and misinformation dumping.

Signatories on the letter underscored “that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement.” Officials took note of their credentials to contend that “our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.”

The contents of the laptop were corroborated by multiple outlets, including the Washington Examiner. Additionally, some signatories, such as Douglas Wise, who served as the Defense Intelligence Agency’s deputy director, have since conceded that some of the contents had to be real.

But during the immediate fallout of the laptop story, social media companies moved to throttle the spread of the story, with Twitter briefly freezing the New York Post’s account and stymieing the sharing of its article.

The report also highlighted recent revelations of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s possible involvement. Blinken had a call with former Obama acting CIA Director Mike Morell, who organized the letter signing, in October 2020, per the report. Morrell testified “yes” and “absolutely” that his call with Blinken was what “triggered that intent in you.”

At the time, Blinken was a top adviser to President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. Multiple Republican senators have accused Blinken of delivering “false testimony” for denying exchanging emails with Hunter Biden.

Morell also testified to the House this year one reason he put together the letter for Biden was “because I wanted him to win the election” against Donald Trump.

Details in the report were amassed from troves of testimony and documents reviewed by the two committees. Investigators emphasized that the “Committees’ oversight into this matter continues in earnest.”

The report comes ahead of House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer’s (R-KY) plans to unveil evidence of an alleged “criminal scheme” involving the Biden family later in the day Wednesday. Read it in full below.
