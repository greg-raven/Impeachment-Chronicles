Something odd just happened --- an article that had been widely published on media sites has suddenly disappeared without any retraction or explanation. Many may have come across it on Reddit.

The article reported that a former senior Soviet KGB spy chief claimed Donald Trump was recruited as a spy by Russian intelligence 38 years ago and given the codename "Krasnov."

We are not confirming its validity, only pointing out the unusual nature of its disappearance.
