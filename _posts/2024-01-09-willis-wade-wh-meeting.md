The Fulton County, Georgia, prosecutor with whom District Attorney Fani Willis allegedly had an "improper" romantic relationship met with the Biden White House twice last year as he worked to investigate former President Trump's alleged election interference, according to court documents.

According to a new filing from a co-defendant in the Trump case, Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade, her alleged partner, to prosecute Trump and benefited financially from the relationship in the form of vacations the two took using funds that his law firm received for working the case.
