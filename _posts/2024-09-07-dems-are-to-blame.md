Sorry, liberal media, your false narratives are going to get kicked in the teeth by us, and you're going to like it. Ryan Wesley Routh tried to kill former President Donald Trump as he played golf at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump's game wasn't planned, so how did Routh know he would be there? It's a weird story, where the assassin, Routh, an anti-Trump, Ukraine war-obsessed clown, reportedly met with dozens of Joe Biden officials and even had multiple interviews with the media about his efforts to help Ukraine. He penned a book urging Iran to kill Trump. Yet, the press has deployed the usual deflections to avoid giving the former president a political leg up against bad Kamala Harris.

It's the second assassination attempt against Trump in 65 days. None of this is normal, and someone with hatred for the former president commits every single one. Routh and Thomas Matthew Crooks, the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally shooter, mainlined the MSNBC drivel about how Trump is an existential threat to our democracy. If this is your war cry 24/7 and people act on it, you're to blame. I don't make the rules --- the left did.

Brit Hume of Fox News asked, "If Donald Trump is held responsible for Jan. 6 because of his allegations that the 2020 election was stolen, is it unfair, after two assassination attempts, to hold responsible the Democrats who have ceaselessly claimed Trump is a threat to democracy?"

Moreover, in another non-shocking development, all the recent bomb threats to besiege Springfield, Ohio, the site of the latest immigration debate concerning Haitians and their alleged eating of pets, were from overseas. They're hoaxes, but that didn't stop the media from trying to frame Trump as a factory for heated rhetoric, which they are the motherlode. The point is the media has once again shown **they're wrong about everything.**

Moreover, another sign that you know the establishment press is cornered is the pivot that Trump will use to score political points. The real concern is not that Trump was targeted again or that a man with a rifle got within 350-500 yards of the former president --- it's that he can use this to beat Kamala on Election Day. It's been a cope and seethe exercise that's been delicious to watch because they can't stop us. We're going to keep posting cat memes now. We will ignore the calls to tone down the rhetoric because we're not the problem.

The left is the cancer. The liberal media is the most prominent voice and purveyor of propaganda for leftist domestic terrorists. They're feeding the machine that wants this man killed. What happened on July 13 and September 15 is their fault, and we should view them as accessories of attempted murder.

Mock them, denigrate them, and, yes, confront their false narratives head-on. It's game time; take the gloves off. What's happening to Trump is the liberal media's fault and that of the Democrats. The real kicker is that their line centers on this return to normalcy, but only if you vote for Kamala and the Democrats.

This game is over, and the liberal media knows it.
