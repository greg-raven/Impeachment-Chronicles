As ... as far as I'm concerned, we have to move very aggressively. It is not about, you know, lingering and trying to think that maybe the courts will help us. I want, even though I know it may not happen, the cabinet ... uh ... that he's appointed ... uh ... a bunch of his sycophites uh who probably won't do what I would recommend. It is time to call for Article 25 of the Constitution of the United States of America to determine his unfitness, to determine that something's wrong with this president. And I would suggest that we move very aggressively to talk about the danger to this country and to our democracy, and not play around with this because this is absolutely one of the most destructive things that this president could do.
