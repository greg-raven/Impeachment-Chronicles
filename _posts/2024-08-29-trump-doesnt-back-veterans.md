A reasonable and real concern.

Trump doesn't have the back of our veterans.

> NEW REPORTING: "A woman who works at the cemetery filed an incident report with the military authorities over the altercation. But the official, who has not been identified, later declined to press charges. Military officials said she feared Mr. Trump's supporters pursuing retaliation."
