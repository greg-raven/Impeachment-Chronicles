We need you to stop for a minute and think about this:

Can you imagine what will happen if Donald Trump wins this election?

We saw the damage he inflicted on our country last time. He separated families at the border, led the crusade to gut our health care, and told people to inject bleach during the COVID-19 pandemic. He provoked a violent [insurrection](/insurrection.html) on the Capitol.

It was awful.
