This is probably the most corrupt president that we've had in American history, and when you look at the optics of this, they don't look good. You mentioned the ties to Hamas, terrorist groups, and child pornography. There is nothing about [pardoning Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao] that made sense about why he would choose to pardon this person.

It made financial sense. It made business sense. It made sense in the operating income of the Trump family ... Donald Trump is treating America like Nino Brown treated the Carter Apartments. Those who get it will get it.

It's just this onslaught of constant favor peddling ... He's treating America like a flea market, and I think that's the most concerning part about this.
