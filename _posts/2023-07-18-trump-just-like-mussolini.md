If you love Mussolini, you will love what Donald Trump is talking about for 2025 ... Trump \[is\] the first major candidate in American history to say outright, "I want a presidential dictatorship." I can't think of anything that is more out of the American tradition.

You've got the front-runner of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, the number two candidate by polls, Ron DeSantis, or DiSantis or whatever it is, they're both fascists. They both want authoritarianism in America.
