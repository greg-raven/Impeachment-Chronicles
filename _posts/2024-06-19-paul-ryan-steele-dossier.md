Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House had in his possession the [Steele dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}) before he had @DevinNunes and I launch Russia Gate Investigation, and never told us (think, before anyone knew anything about fake intel, he had his own copy). I found it on my own then blew up FBI/DOJ. Why didn't he tell his own damn team? Report that fake news.
