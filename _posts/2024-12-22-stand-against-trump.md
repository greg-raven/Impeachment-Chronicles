With under a month until Trump is sworn into office, the president-elect is already nominating a rogue's gallery of MAGA loyalists to his Cabinet, proposing steep trade tariffs that economists say would spike inflation, and putting the Postal Service and Department of Education on the chopping block.

We can rest assured that, no matter what comes, it will be more important than ever to speak truth to power.

This February, The New Republic will produce a new event as a clarion call to respond to Trump 2.0 --- America in Crisis: Navigating the Dark Road Ahead. Live from Washington, D.C., it will gather the top minds in politics and culture determined to mitigate the possible damages of a second Trump term.

We're raising $25,000 to support this engaging event --- which is a very achievable goal if everyone who reads this pitch gives even a small amount.

Help us fight the all-too-real danger of a second Trump presidency by donating today.

We need your help to make it happen.
