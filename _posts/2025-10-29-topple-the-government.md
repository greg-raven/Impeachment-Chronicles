> Surround the White House. Surround the Capitol. Surround the illegitimate fascist-packed Supreme Court.

Far-left group, Refuse Fascism, is organizing an insurrection on Nov. 5 in Washington, D.C. The plan is to besiege government buildings and streets until the U.S. government is toppled.

> Surround the White House. Surround the Capitol. Surround the illegitimate fascist-packed Supreme Court. Come back again and again. Across the country, refuse to comply. Every person of conscience, millions of us together, grind the machinery of the fascist regime to a halt.

> The Trump Fascist Regime is illegitimate. What it is demanding we become is unconscionable. At every level of society, in every institution, tens of millions of us know this in our bones. If we dare, we can defeat a horror that threatens humanity's very survival. If we fail to even try, future generations --- if they exist --- will never forgive us.
