IRS Whistleblowers Involved in Hunter Biden Tax Case Reveal IRS, DOJ, and FBI Knew Laptop "Was Real" Immediately; Claim Prosecutors Demanded They Not Ask Questions About Joe Biden Ahead of 2020 Election

"There were a lot of overt investigative steps that we were not allowed to take because we had an upcoming election."

"The prosecutors ... told us that they didn't want to ask about 'The Big Guy.'"

"We corroborated that 'The Big Guy' was Joe Biden. Yes."

"There was no question ever that 'The Big Guy' was referring to Joe Biden."

"It was for the purpose of affecting that [2020] election."
