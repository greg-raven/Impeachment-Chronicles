During questioning from Special Counsel John Durham, Brian Auten, a supervisory counter intelligence analyst with the FBI, revealed the FBI offered Christopher Steele one million dollars if he could corroborate allegations in [the Dossier](http://greg-raven.github.io/Impeachment-Chronicles/2016/06/20/the-steele-dossier/), but that Steele could not do so.

Auten repeatedly admitted under questioning from Durham that the FBI never got corroboration of the information in the [Steele Dossier](http://greg-raven.github.io/Impeachment-Chronicles/2016/06/20/the-steele-dossier/) but used it in the initial FISA application and in the three subsequent renewals.
