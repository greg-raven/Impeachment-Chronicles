During questioning from Special Counsel John Durham, Brian Auten, a supervisory counter intelligence analyst with the FBI, revealed the FBI offered Christopher Steele one million dollars if he could corroborate allegations in [the Dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}), but that Steele could not do so.

Auten repeatedly admitted under questioning from Durham that the FBI never got corroboration of the information in the [Steele Dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}) but used it in the initial FISA application and in the three subsequent renewals.
