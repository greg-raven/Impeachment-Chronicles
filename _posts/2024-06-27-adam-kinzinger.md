Hi, I'm Adam Kinzinger. I'm a proud conservative. And yesterday, because of my unwavering support for democracy, I made an announcement:

I'm endorsing Joe Biden for reelection.

There's too much at stake to sit on the sidelines as Donald Trump threatens the future of America. He's called for "termination" of the constitution, continued to stoke political violence, and admitted he'll act as a dictator on "day one" if reelected.

The former president doesn't care about our country. He doesn't care about you. He only cares about himself, and he will do or say anything in pursuit of power -- no matter who it hurts.

So, here I am, a Republican asking millions of Americans to rush a donation to help reelect a Democratic president. Will you donate $25 or even more to President Biden's campaign before tonight's debate? We desperately need President Biden in the Oval Office to protect what makes this country great: our democracy.

\[...\]

My entire life has been guided by the conviction that America is a beacon of liberty, freedom, and democracy.

Donald Trump is an existential threat to every fundamental American value.

He won't defend democracy. He's a dangerous mob leader who attacked the foundation of our nation, encouraging a violent group of supporters to march on the Capitol to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.

I didn't just watch the insurrection on TV --- I lived through it. I felt the presence of evil on that day.

We can't retreat to our partisan corners. We can't sit quietly and hope that Donald Trump is defeated. No, now is the time to work together to be part of the solution. We all must take an active role in supporting Joe Biden's campaign, which is why I will ask you again: Will you pitch in $25 or any amount so President Biden has the resources to defeat Donald Trump?

I want my son, Christian, to be raised in a country where decency in the greatest office of the land still matters. I want him to be led by an honorable person, a person who tells the truth, who appeals to our virtues --- not our vices.

I certainly don't agree with President Biden on everything, but I know that he will always protect our democracy. And there's nothing more important than that.

Thank you for doing your part,

Adam Kinzinger<br>
Fmr. U.S. Congressman
