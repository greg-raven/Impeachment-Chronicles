Quoted from www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy: "President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule."

Donald Trump is planning to use $50 trillion worth of fossil fuels to power the United States.

Currently a commonly accepted idea: Global Warming. How would this $50 trillion worth of fossil fuels affect global warming? Here's a more precise number: $50,000,000,000,000 worth of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are used as fuels to release heat, for example, using charcoal to heat up your barbecues. Fossil fuels work like charcoal, except on a much larger scale. Fossil fuels contain carbon atoms, that combine with oxygen, to form carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, when there is not enough oxygen (which happens quite often).

For carbon dioxide, this gas acts as a greenhouse gas, which means it stores heat energy from the sun. What it mean for us is that, our temperatures would fluctuate much more. It could go from 45 degrees Celsius in the summer in the afternoon to 25 degrees Celsius in the night of summer and as cold as -25 degrees Celsius in the night during winters. These freak weather is not a joke, in fact, a recent similar freak weather occured in Europe (except on a smaller scale). Also, as the average temperature increases, more and more of the polar ice caps would melt. You can check out how much of the world would be flooded should even 10m of the sea rise at this URL: https://geology.com/sea-level-rise/ And that is just for carbon dioxide.

For carbon monoxide, it is exactly the same as carbon dioxide, colourless and odourless, except that it can kill humans at 5,000 parts per million in 5 minutes. That means that for every breath you take in, should even 0.5% of it be carbon monoxide, you are in a lot of trouble.

In conclusion, should Donald Trump not be stopped, Earth would become inhabitable for humans to live in, because of extreme weather and toxic gas AND NO ONE WOULD BE THERE TO SAVE US. Donald Trump will cause the end of humanity as we know it, or even the entire end of humanity. Share this with those you love, and this petition should just be used as a stepping board so that you will know more about what would happen if Donald Trump continues his presidency. Share the news and if enough people knows about this and believes in this and works towards a non-Trump-Presidency, Donald Trump shall be president no more and humanity shall live forever more. There is a point called the point of no return, and it will happen sometime in the next 4 years should Trump not be stopped.

Side note: If you always believed in the end of the world, it would happen sooner than you realise, so at least try to stop it, so your children would be able to see the light of day.
