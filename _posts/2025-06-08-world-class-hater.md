The thing about Stephen Miller is not that he is the brains behind Trumpism.

Yes, he is one of the people who conceptualizes the impulses of the Trumpist movement and translates them into policy.

But that's not what's interesting about Miller.

It's not brains. It's bile.

Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. He's a world-class hater.

You can see this just by looking at him because you can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate.

Trump is a world-class hater. But his hatred only a means to an end, and that end his his own glorification. That's his spiritual nourishment.
