Far-left Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is openly calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.

At an anti-Trump “Tax March” rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, Waters told the crowd of angry protesters she doesn’t “respect” Trump and believes he should be impeached.

“I don’t respect this president,” Waters said. “I don’t trust this president. He’s not working in the best interests of the American people. His motives and his actions are contemptable.”

“I will fight every day until he is impeached,” Waters continued. “Impeach 45! Impeach 45!”

The crowd responded with a unified chant mimicking Waters. “Impeach 45!” the crowd yelled.

The number 45 is a reference to Trump being the 45th president.

“Don’t forget who he is,” Waters continued. “He has shown us what kind of human being is, and he is not going to change. Ladies and gentlemen, my millennials, stay woke!”

Waters has been one of Trump’s fiercest critics in Congress.

On Friday, she issued a series of messages on Twitter suggesting Trump is guilty of colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">> Trump worked so hard this week to make people believe he was fighting w/ Putin. Trump will never criticize Putin b/c he's in bed w/ him.

“The question remains what does Putin have on Trump that he is seemingly the ONLY person Trump will not criticize in any way?” Waters also said.
