Washington, D.C. --- In what may become the most explosive revelation in U.S. political history, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced that declassified intelligence files directly implicate former President Barack Obama in authorizing a covert assassination attempt on then President-elect Donald Trump. The files, set to be publicly released, detail a sprawling, top-secret program initiated in the final 30 days of Obama's presidency, with the explicit goal of preventing Trump from ever taking office.

"Operation Silence was not just surveillance. It was an organized, multi-agency plot to eliminate the President-elect," Gabbard said during an emergency intelligence briefing. "The documents outline everything, from recruitment of black ops teams, to manipulation of communications, to the final phase; physical removal." According to sources close to the investigation, a failed attempt on Trump's life was thwarted only days before the inauguration, thanks to an anonymous whistleblower inside the National Security Command Center.

Redacted transcripts reveal that Obama, under the pretense of national security, convened an off the books task force of senior intelligence officials and military advisors at Camp David in late December. One document, marked Eyes Only 44, reads: "The threat Trump poses to institutional stability cannot be overstated. Removal, if necessary, is justified." While Obama has not commented publicly, legal teams are reportedly mobilizing behind the scenes. As the files prepare to go public, the country teeters on the edge of political reckoning, and the question now isn't whether there was a plot, but how far it went, and who else was involved.
