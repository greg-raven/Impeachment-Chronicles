Unbelievable:

New DOJ IG report reveals FBI paid a Confidential Human Source for travel to DC on January 6th, 2021.

FBI knew the CHS entered the Capitol on 1/6.

They then tasked the CHS to attend the 1/20 inauguration and repaid him.

That's right: Paid, not prosecuted!

> As previously noted, we also found that another CHS who was not tasked with being in DC on January 6 entered the Capitol, and after January 6, provided information to the CHS's field office, including video footage from the Capitol. The field office provided this information to FO, which subsequently asked the field office to task the CHS with attending the Inauguration. The CHS attended the Inauguration and was reimbursed for the CHS's travel on January 6 and for the
Inauguration, even though the CHS was only tasked with attending the Inauguration.
