I ... like ... you're gonna do sig hail, you're gonna do a hail Hitler, or they rebrand a "roman salute" from behind the presidential seal of the United States of America? It's on. It's on.

And what is so important for us to understand is that as long as we don't give up, it's not over. It's not over. It is not over.

Uh, LibsOfTikTok started crying because because I said over the weekend that Donald Trump is a rapist, and I went on Twitter and they went, oh, boo, hoooo, and I said, basically, F you, cry more, I don't give a shit.

Like, you wanna support a rapist, that's on you. That's on you.

But I don't and it wanted to call in all of these threats into my office and all this other stuff.

I don't give a damn. I don't give a damn. I don't give a damn.

Context:

The Democrat Party has a serious Nazi problem.

Hereâ€™s Kamala Harris, AOC, and Hillary Clinton, making the Sieg Heil salute in what some are reporting as a clear support for Adolf Hitler.

This behavior is terrible.
