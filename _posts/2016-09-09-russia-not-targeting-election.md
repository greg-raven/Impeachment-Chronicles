An <abbr title="Office of the Director of National Intelligence">ODNI</abbr> and <abbr title="President's Daily Brief">PDB</abbr> official says that an upcoming PDB should make clear that Russia "probably is not trying ... to influence the election by using cyber means" to target election infrastructure. Several <abbr title="Intelligence Community">IC</abbr> officials agree.

The lead author on the PDB agrees.
