Panel 3: Political Prospects for a New Center-Right

Moderator: Geoffrey Kabaservice

Panelists: Whit Ayres, Juleanna Glover, Mike Murphy

\[…\]

Whit Ayres: Individuals are really important. And we saw that with Donald Trump. We’d have a different world if Marco Rubio had been the presidential nominee of the Republican Party. I honestly don’t know how to answer that question without knowing two things: What’s in the Mueller report and how does the Trump era end? If it ends with his re-election and a reasonably successful second term (at least economically), it’s a very different picture than if he gets impeached and removed from office. And so I really… I can’t get a good bead on it until we know those two things.
