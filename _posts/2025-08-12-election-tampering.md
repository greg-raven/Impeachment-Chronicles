Tulsi Gabbard says that evidence now exists showing electronic voting machines have been tampered with to manipulate U.S. election outcomes, including the 2020 presidential race.

The Director of National Intelligence detailed the sweeping investigation into election interference into people within the intelligence community that were holdovers from the Obama administration and others that she said had plans to overthrow the government in the 2020 election.

> "We have evidence showing that these electronic voting systems have long been vulnerable to hackers, and open to exploitation to manipulate the results of votes cast."
>
> "This further underscores the urgent need to bring about paper ballots nationwide, so voters can have faith in the integrity of our elections."

Gabbard has advocated for ditching hackable machines in favor of verifiable paper trails.

She has also declassified documents exposing Obama-era conspiracies connected to the Russian interference hoax of  2016.

Her investigations have uncovered evidence of the weaponization of the FBI and CIA --- among others in and connected to the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton.

She's also uncovered fabricated reports and cyber vulnerabilities in voting systems that allowed hackers to access those voting machines.

Declassified reports detail how electronic voting systems, used in multiple states during 2020, were susceptible to remote hacking and manipulation to alter results.

The documents detail specific instances where vote tallies were altered --- evidence Gabbard said was proof of election interference orchestrated by the Obama administration.

Gabbard's update accuses the intelligence community --- Obama holdovers --- of working with others to send out rigged machines.

She is pushing for hand-marked paper ballots to be used immediately, saying that electronic systems' flaws --- known since at least 2016 --- invite fraud.
