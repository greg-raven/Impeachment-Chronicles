What the actual f**k!?!? @realDonaldTrump should be immediately impeached and then put on trial for treason.  His actions led to the deaths of American soldiers. He is a traitor to our nation and all those who have served.  He is #BenedictDonald. [https://x.com/AP/status/1277793052099256322]({% post_url 2020-06-30-russian-bounties %})
