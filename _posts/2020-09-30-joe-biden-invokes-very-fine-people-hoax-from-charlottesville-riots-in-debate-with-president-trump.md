- Moderator Chris Wallace didn’t bother correcting Biden’s false statement

You knew he was going there — and sure enough, he did.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden — with most of mainstream media squarely behind him — during Tuesday’s debate with President Donald Trump invoked the tired, long-ago debunked hoax that Trump referred to neo-Nazis and white nationalists at the 2017 riots in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “very fine people.”

What was said?

“Close your eyes, remember what those people looked like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging … just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan — a young woman got killed — and they asked the president what he thought, he said there were very fine people on both sides,” Biden remarked. “No president has said anything like that.”
