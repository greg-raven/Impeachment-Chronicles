Meet Jennifer Collins. She is a professor in the American Studies department at the @UofAlabama.

She describes the Pennsylvania assassin as "a really lousy shot" who not only missed Trump but also the people behind him. She then suggests that Trump fake his own assassination and she posts a video of the song "Cell Block Tango," which includes the lyrics, "He had it comin', he only had himself to blame."

These are the people educating your children.

Would you like to comment on it, @UofAlabama?

> Someone is a really lousy shot because they not only missed his large ass but they missed AAALLLL those people behind him too. Weird, huh? 😒 Weird there was no blood until he grabbed his own face. Could he follow the assassination plan handbook any closer?? I think not.
