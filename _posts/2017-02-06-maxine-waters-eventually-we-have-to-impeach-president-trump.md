- ‘I have not called for the impeachment yet, he is doing it himself.’

EXCERPT:

WATERS: “How can a president, who is acting and the manner that he is acting, whether he is talking about the travel ban, the way that he is talking about Muslims, or whether he’s talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, knowing that they have hacked our D-triple-C and DNC, and knowing that he’s responsible supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in Aleppo and the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Crimea — I think that he is leading himself into that kind of position where folks will begin to ask what are we going to do, and the answer is going to be, ‘Eventually, we have to do something about him.’ We cannot continue to have a president who is acting in this manner. It is dangerous to the United states of America.”
