- Kevin Clinesmith will admit he altered a document involving Carter Page's ties to the CIA.

Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of altering a document in the Russia collusion probe, the first criminal case to be brought in the investigation of U.S. Attorney John Durham, two sources told Just the News.

The plea deal, first reported by *The New York Times,* could be unveiled in court later Friday, the sources said.

Clinesmith's lawyer issued a statement to *The Washington Post* apologizing for his conduct.

"Kevin deeply regrets having altered the email. It was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues as he believed the information he relayed was accurate. But Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility," the lawyer told the *Post.*

Clinesmith's misconduct was first revealed last December in a Justice Department inspector general report that widely criticized the FBI's conduct in the Russia collusion probe against President Trump. The report said he worked in the FBI general counsel's office and altered an email to hide the fact that former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was a source for the CIA.

The FBI never revealed to the FISA court that authorized surveillance of Page that Page assisted the agency.
