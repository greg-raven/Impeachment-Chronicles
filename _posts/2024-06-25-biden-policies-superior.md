16 Nobel-prize winning economists have called President Biden's policies "vastly superior," to Trump's.

They also issued a dire warning for America, saying that Trump's fiscal policies would reignite inflation, and cause lasting harm to the global economy if he returns to the White House.

When Trump left office, unemployment was at 6.4% and consumer confidence was only at 87. Under President Biden, unemployment has remained at or below 4% for the past 2 years, with consumer confidence up at 101.3

In a letter the Nobel laureates have written about Biden and Trump, they stated "While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we all agree that Joe Biden's economic agenda is vastly superior to Donald Trump."

The letter acknowledged the inflation issue that has plagued the global economy, noting that compared to the rest of the world, America's "has come down remarkably fast."
