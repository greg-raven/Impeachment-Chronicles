The latest report by Project Veritas is raising questions about possible collusion between the mainstream media and government agencies to discredit Donald Trump and Republican voters. A new investigation by the non-profit journalism enterprise revealed mainstream media knew that FBI informants were inside the capitol during the January 6 protest.

The latest expose features confessions by Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times reporter Matthew Rosenberg who has covered the capitol protest as a "matter on national security." However, Rosenberg now admits the entire January 6 narrative was greatly exaggerated or even made up.

Over the past year, Rosenberg has written stories painting the capitol protest as a pre-mediated conspiracy by Donald Trump and friends to "subvert" American democracy. For example, on February 1 last year his article claims "a lie the former president had been grooming for years overwhelmed the Republican Party and stoked the assault on the capitol." However now Rosenberg says nobody was in danger during that protest, including mainstream media reporters who went inside the capitol.

The New York Times reporter also spoke about FBI presence at the January 6 rally, which in the past raised questions by Republican lawmakers. In particular, Rep. Matt Gaetz and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene have voiced concerns the breach of U.S. Capitol could be a ploy to discredit Republican voters.

Meanwhile, Rosenberg appeared to suggest the New York Times editorial stance on the matter is shifting towards downplaying those events as if it's no big deal. He went on to suggest slanted January 6 coverage is only part of a greater narrative aimed at attacking and discrediting Donald Trump. This includes attacks on Trump before the 2016 election, during his time in office and beyond.

Rosenberg's confessions suggest mainstream media is presenting wishful thinking of its writers as factual news, which it is not. Meanwhile, potential efforts by federal agencies to manipulate public opinion may pose a greater concern moving forward..
