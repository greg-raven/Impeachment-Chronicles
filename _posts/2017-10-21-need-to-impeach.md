On October 21, 2017, Tom Steyer launched Need to Impeach in order to pressure Congress to hold the most corrupt president in U.S. history accountable.

Over 8.5 million Need to Impeach petition signers rallied together to help flip the House in 2018 â€” and then, through calls, emails, petitions, tweets, and notecards, they kept up the pressure on their newly elected Representatives to do their jobs.
