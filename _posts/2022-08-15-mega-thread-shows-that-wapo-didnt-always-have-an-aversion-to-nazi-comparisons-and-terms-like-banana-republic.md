<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div></figure>Perhaps to some degree the WaPo is laying off any Hitler comparisons because they have to save that for later when their “why DeSantis is more dangerous than Trump” hot takes are being churned out.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div></figure>Of course!

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">> There are plenty more than this.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div></figure>True. The Washington Post should not be taken seriously.
