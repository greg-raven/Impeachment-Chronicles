This might shock you, but the *Washington Post* has been spotted having some evolving standards when it comes to hyperbolic rhetoric to describe presidential administrations and government agencies:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🧵The Washington Post has published at least two articles complaining about hyperbolic criticism of the FBI coming from the right.<br /><br />They don't like people using terms like &quot;banana republic&quot; or &quot;dictatorship.&quot;<br /><br />Here's a little thread showing why they are full of bovine excrement.</p>&mdash; Jeff Charles, Agent of Chaos🏴 (@jeffcharlesjr) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffcharlesjr/status/1558883794224021504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2022</a></blockquote>

We always knew the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" news outlet has covered themselves in ironic and hypocritical BS for a long time, and now it's been applied even thicker. You won't be surprised to know when the *Washington Post's* aversion to extreme rhetoric to describe an administration began:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's a little ditty comparing Trump's America to the Holocaust<a href="https://t.co/IGwpanksjY">https://t.co/IGwpanksjY</a></p>&mdash; Jeff Charles, Agent of Chaos🏴 (@jeffcharlesjr) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffcharlesjr/status/1558883795704709120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's another linking Trump to Nazis because of the phrase &quot;America First.&quot;<a href="https://t.co/QWWBaLYGng">https://t.co/QWWBaLYGng</a></p>&mdash; Jeff Charles, Agent of Chaos🏴 (@jeffcharlesjr) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffcharlesjr/status/1558883796757499904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2022</a></blockquote>

Nobody will ever accuse the Biden administration of being "America first," that's for sure.

Perhaps to some degree the WaPo is laying off any Hitler comparisons because they have to save that for later when their "why DeSantis is more dangerous than Trump" hot takes are being churned out.

Of course!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are plenty more than this.

True. The *Washington Post* should not be taken seriously.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Washington Post and New York Times complaining about FBI and IRS criticism is the biggest tell of all-time.<br /><br />It shows just how far their 'journalism' as fallen and has been replaced by state-run media<a href="https://t.co/5QcCsCGKah">https://t.co/5QcCsCGKah</a></p>&mdash; Kyle Becker (@kylenabecker) <a href="https://twitter.com/kylenabecker/status/1559195677820862464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2022</a></blockquote>
