The <abbr title="Intelligence Community">IC</abbr> publishes an Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on cyber threats to the election. The report finds "foreign adversaries do not have and will probably not obtain the capabilities to successfully execute widespread and undetected cyber attacks" on election infrastructure.

Two days later, the IC publishes the aforementioned <abbr title="President's Daily Briefing">PDB</abbr> with near identical findings. It finds that foreign adversaries do not have the capability to "covertly overturn the vote outcome."
