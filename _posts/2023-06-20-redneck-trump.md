Samuel L. Jackson says he sees in former President Trump the "same rednecks" who hurled racist slurs at him as a kid.

[...]

"When I see Trump, I see the same rednecks I saw when I was growing up â€¦ [who] tried to keep me in my place," Jackson said, adding that they would direct racist insults at him.

[...]

"If you're not saying anything," Jackson said at the time, "then you're complicit."
