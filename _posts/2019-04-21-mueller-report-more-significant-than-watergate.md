House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's report were more significant than the Watergate scandal that led to the end of Richard Nixon's presidency.

Schiff, D-Calif., was pressed by "This Week" host Martha Raddatz to answer for his past assertions that there was "ample and abundant" evidence of collusion between President Trump and Russia. She pointed out that Schiff said on the show previously the alleged scandal was "of a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."

"I think it's clear from the [Mueller report]({% post_url 2019-03-22-mueller-report %}) that that's exactly right. The obstruction of justice in particular in this case is far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did," Schiff said.

Schiff compared the report, which found Trump's campaign did not conspire with Russia, to the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate building in Washington, D.C.

"The break-in by the Russians of the democratic institutions, a foreign adversary, is far more significant than the plumbers breaking into the Democratic headquarters," Schiff said. "So yes, I would say in every way this is more significant than Watergate."

Schiff also brought up Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last year where Trump suggested he didn't believe U.S. intelligence reports that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

"The fact that the president of the United States would take Putin's side over his own intelligence agencies (goes) well beyond anything Richard Nixon did, and so yes, I think it is far more serious than Watergate," Schiff said.

Mueller's report was released Thursday, and also showed the Mueller team also make a determination on whether the president obstructed justice. Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote a four-page summary last month that cleared Trump of both of those accusations.
