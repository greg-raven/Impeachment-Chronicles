The FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Lt. General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) "as part of the larger [Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %}) umbrella" investigation into the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump and its possible coordination with Russian officials to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. Code-named "Crossfire Razor," the investigation's stated "goal" was to determine whether Mr. Flynn "was directed and controlled by and/or coordinated activities with the Russian Federation in a manner which is a threat to the national security and/or possibly a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 951 et seq., or other related statutes."
