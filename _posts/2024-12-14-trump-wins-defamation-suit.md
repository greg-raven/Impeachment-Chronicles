George Stephanopoulos and ABC are forced to apologize to President Trump and  pay $15 million to settle a defamation suit. 

Trump filed a defamation suit against Stephanopoulos after the anchor and former Democrat operative asserted that Trump was found "liable for rape" during an interview with with Rep. Nancy Mace in March.

After playing a clip, Stephanopoulos said: "You've endorsed Donald Trump for president. Judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape." 

Stephanopoulos was alluding to accuser E. Jean Carroll, a case in which she couldn't remember the year the alleged "assault" took place, and for which New York State passed a one-year law extending the statute of limitations so the case could proceed during an election year.

Stephanopoulos repeated that "rape" claim ten times during the contentious interview with Mace, despite the fact that a jury actually determined Trump was liable for "sexual abuse," in a civil case, not rape, which holds a clear legal distinction in New York.

Legacy media down hard.
