Monday was President Joe Biden’s big presentation on gun control, since that’s the No. 1 issue facing Americans today, after inflation, gas prices, Ukraine, the border, and just about anything else you could think of. Biden daintily picked up a ghost gun to show to reporters (that it’s just another gun) and also named his new pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms after his last pick, David Chipman, flamed out and withdrew his name from consideration thanks to some racist remarks uncovered by Stephen Gutowski at The Reload.

People are already scouring the Twitter feed of Biden’s new pick, Steve Dettelback, and found [this winner from 2016](/2016/06/05/we-salute-muhammad-ali-as-a-great-american.html):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We salute <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuhammadAli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MuhammadAli</a> as a great American. Sadly, we need to acknowledge that Donald Trump wouldn&#39;t even allow him to come into America.</p>&mdash; Steve Dettelbach (@SteveDettelbach) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveDettelbach/status/739622713724002305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
