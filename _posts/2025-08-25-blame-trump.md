Young men are flocking to the GOP in distressing numbers, and thanks to them, Generation Z is on track to be the most pro-Republican in a very long time.

Trump's policies directly damage the industries that employ young men, but when layoffs come, the right blames women, immigrants, and "wokeness" rather than the real culprit --- the right itself.

Republicans break their jobs, then harvest their anger --- while Democrats get the blame.
