Rough transcript:

> Jake Tapper: Is it fair to tie in any way what happened at the Emanuel AME Church to Donald Trump? Donald Trump had barely launched his campaign when that attack happened.
>
> Jim Clyburn: Well thank you very much for having me, Jake. I think it is very clear uh the Donald Trump's utterances uh way back before Charlottesville or at the time of Charlottsville ties him uh to uh what happened at at Mother Emanuel. The fact of the matter is that young man went into that Church's basement, joined with those worshippers in Bible study, and murdered them. And he said at the time that he was attempting to create a race war.
