Rep. Devin Nunes said there is no evidence of collusion to be found in dozens of witness transcripts that the House Intelligence Committee is poised to release.

Nunes, who is the top Republican on the panel, said the public disclosure of these transcripts will show Chairman Adam Schiff told "lie after lie after lie" to the public about there being proof the Trump campaign was conspiring with the Russians during the 2016 election.

"There's no going to be any major bombshells in this because the Democrats already leaked all the supposed bombshells and lied about those bombshells," Nunes told Fox Business host Lou Dobbs on Wednesday.

Schiff, who has stressed there was "direct evidence" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, is now "in panic mode," a senior administration source told Fox News. The California Democrat signaled on Wednesday he would release 53 witness transcripts, which had been unanimously approved for release by the committee two years ago, only after acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell said the redaction and declassification process was complete and he would put them out if the committee did not.

Schiff's office pinned the blame on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for the "unnecessary delay" and the White House for "its improper insistence on reviewing key transcripts," even as GOP lawmakers and Trump administration officials blamed Schiff for the delay.

Nunes said the "most interesting" transcripts will be those of interviews with Obama administration officials, which he hinted will expose the Democrats "covering this up."

Among them are former Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, and former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice. Additional witnesses included Trump associates as well as other government and political figures.

"I think for the good guy side and the real investigators that are trying to get to the bottom of the Russia hoax and who was involved in it, there will be likely people who were not so truthful to Congress, let's just say," Nunes added later.

The Republicans, who were in command of the House Intelligence Committee at the time, released a report in April 2018 that said they found no collusion in their investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Democrats argued the investigation was shut down prematurely. A year later, special counsel Robert Mueller said his team's investigation “did not establish” any criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

As for when exactly Schiff will release the transcripts, Nunes doubts it will be any time soon because he believes "90% of the media" are "covering this up" and won't hold the chairman accountable.

"So, you ask when you’re going to see them. I guess if some of the Russia hoaxers ask, 'Hey, are we going to see these transcripts?', they’ll be out in a nanosecond. If no one does, they’ll delay as long as possible, and they'll release them on a Friday night, you know, before Thanksgiving or, you know, over Thanksgiving weekend or something," he said.

Schiff released 57 transcripts and related material from the investigation on Thursday.
