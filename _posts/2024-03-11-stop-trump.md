It looks like it's most likely to be Donald Trump and Joe Biden, but we don't know that for sure. Uh and I I think that it's going to require making an assessment about sort of um how we can most effectively mobilize people in both parties and mobilize independents, frankly, to stand against Donald Trump. Um I I think you know there's a lot that has to be done to begin to rebuild the Republican Party. Potentially to build a new conservative party. But in my view that has to wait until after the 2024 election because our focus has got to be on defeating Donald Trump.
