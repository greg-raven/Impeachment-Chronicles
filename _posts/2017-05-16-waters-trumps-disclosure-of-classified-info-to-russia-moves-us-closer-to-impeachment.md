Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) on Tuesday spoke at the Center for American Progress Ideas Conference in Washington, where she claimed that Monday’s Washington Post report on President Trump sharing classified intelligence with Russian diplomats moves Congress closer to impeaching him.

“We don’t have to be afraid to use the word impeachment,” Waters said. “We don’t have to think that impeachment is out of our reach. All we have to do is make sure that we are talking to the American public, that we are keeping them involved, that we are resisting every day, and we are challenging every day.”

Waters added that she is not sure how the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials will develop, but she believes Congress is moving closer to impeachment after Monday’s report.

The Post reported that Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a White House meeting last Friday pertaining to an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.

“I think this is going to put us a little bit further on our way to what I’ve been calling for for so long, and that is impeachment,” Waters concluded.

The White House pushed back against the Post‘s story on Tuesday, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters that Trump’s actions were “appropriate.”
