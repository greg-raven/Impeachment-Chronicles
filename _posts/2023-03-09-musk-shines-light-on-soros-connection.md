Twitter CEO Elon Musk has weighed in on what many believe is the impending indictment of former President Donald trump by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg by shoving George Soros under the bus.

It came in response to a tweet by popular conservative Twitter commentator Catturd who said "Corrupt New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg received $1 million from Soros in his election for NYC DA."

Musk responded by basically laying out the game that Soros plays to effect policy in the United States.

"Soros figured out a clever arbitrage opportunity: The many small political contests, such as DAs & judges, have much higher impact per dollar spent than the big races, so it is far easier to sway the outcome," he said.

And it is a well known fact that Soros' money is behind several high profile district attorneys in the nation whose campaigns he assisted with funding and they are all far left.

And Musk was not the only one to call out Soros for his connection to the district attorney.

"Alvin Bragg is bought by George Soros. He allows violent criminals to walk the streets of New York City, but will prosecute the likely Republican nominee (and former president) on a baseless misdemeanor charge. These people are trying to turn America into a third-world country," Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance said.

"Is it any surprise that the driving force behind the Trump indictment witch hunt is a District Attorney in New York backed by none other than George Soros?" Benny Johnson said.

"George Soros gave $1M to Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's campaign. Bragg downgraded 52% of felonies to misdemeanors in NYC in 2022. But now Bragg plans to elevate a piddly misdemeanor to a felony because it's Trump. This is political persecution," Liz Wheeler said.

"Bragg's indictment of President Trump for a created crime is the final straw in Bragg's destruction of the reputation of the foremost DAs' office in the United States. Bought and paid for the by thy man who despises American nationalism, George Soros," former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said.

"George Soros is an EVIL person who wants to tear this country apart. His handpicked prosecutor has made destroying Trump his top priority. They want EVERY conservative arrested and in jail. These people want COMMUNISM in America!!" Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson said.

"George Soros spent over $1 million to elect Alvin Bragg DA of Manhattan. He is now pleading down the charges of violent criminals and letting them back on the street while trying to put Trump in jail on total politically motivated charges. Soros is getting what he paid for," Greg Price said.

Constitutional expert and Georgetown University law professor Jonathan Turley noted in a column published on Saturday that the alleged coming indictment of former President Donald Trump by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg will be a "made-for-TV" event that, in reality, is "legally pathetic."

"'The moment that we are waiting for, we made it to the finale together' — those familiar words from 'America's Got Talent' — could well be the opening line for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg next week, when he is expected to unveil an indictment of former President Trump," Turley said.

"With Trump's reported announcement that he expects to be arrested on Tuesday, it would be a fitting curtain raiser for a case that has developed more like a television production than a criminal prosecution. Indeed, this indictment was repeatedly rejected only to be brought back by popular demand," he added.

"Trump faces serious legal threats in the ongoing Mar-a-Lago investigation. But the New York case would be easily dismissed outside of a jurisdiction like New York, where Bragg can count on highly motivated judges and jurors," Turley noted, adding: "Although it may be politically popular, the case is legally pathetic."

Bragg is facing difficulties in interpreting state laws in a manner that would enable him to successfully prosecute a federal case that the Justice Department had already dismissed against Trump concerning his payment of "hush money" to adult film star Stormy Daniels. As far back as 2018, Turley said he had written about the challenges of pursuing such a federal case under existing election laws. Presently, six years later, the same theory may be forced to fit into a state claim, he noted.
