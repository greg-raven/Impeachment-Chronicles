In a report released Tuesday, the Justice Department's inspector general said the DOJ targeted two lawmakers and 43 staffers in an effort to unearth leaks to journalists. Records of Trump's pick to be the next FBI director, Kash Patel, were obtained as a part of the investigation. Patel was serving as a House staffer at the time.

"This report lays out outrageous behavior by the Department of Justice, where members of Congress and staff of the Intelligence Committee, the committee that I chair, had phone records and email records that were accessed by the Department of Justice without court review," Turner told CNN on Tuesday.
