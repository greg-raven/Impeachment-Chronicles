After the New York Post published its story on Hunter Biden's laptop, about 50 former intelligence officials signed a letter saying that the story had all the earmarks of Russian disinformation â€” which gave the mainstream media an excuse not to cover the story. We've since learned that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was working with the Biden campaign at the time, and former acting CIA director Mike Morell were behind the letter â€” "because I wanted him to win the election," Morell testified.

Now congressional testimony reveals that the CIA actively solicited signatures for the letter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸš¨ðŸš¨BREAKING: The CIA actively promoted and solicited signatures for the Biden campaign&#39;s infamous Hunter Biden laptop letter, blockbuster congressional testimony shows. <a href="https://t.co/t3HqRGBs6k">https://t.co/t3HqRGBs6k</a></p>&mdash; Sean Davis (@seanmdav) <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1656041420539478020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Sean Davis reports:

> The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) both solicited signatures for and eventually approved the infamous 2020 letter claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop story was a Russian disinformation plot, recent congressional testimony suggests. According to a report to be released Wednesday by the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, multiple former U.S. intelligence officials testified under oath about the CIA's involvement in the distribution of the letter, which was eventually signed by more than 50 former senior U.S. intelligence officials.

> Emails obtained by the House weaponization subcommittee also revealed that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who repeatedly peddled false allegations that Trump had colluded with Russian President Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, had a heavy hand in the drafting of the Hunter Biden laptop letter.

> "I have one editorial suggestion for the letter: I think it would strengthen the verbiage if you say this has all the classic earmarks of a Soviet/Russian information operation rather than the 'feel' of a Russian operation," Clapper wrote to Morell on the evening of Sunday, Oct. 18, 2020.

CNN contributor James Clapper said that?
