LAWFARE: Obama judge blocks Trump's implementation of The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport members of the Venezuelan paramilitary gang Tren de Aragua. The judge didn't think violating executive power was a good enough excuse to allow the president to exercise his power. Trump's lawyers failed to point out that that allowing gang members to remain in the US illegally because Democrats want them to stay is a draw for other illegals to come here.
