Soon-to-be EX-Congressman Liz Cheney has revealed her delusional plan to keep Donald Trump from running for President in 2024: Get the Jan 6 Committee to arrest him.

"Ultimately the Justice Department will decide that," the J6 vice chair told ABC's Jon Carl, referring to plans to refer Trump for criminal prosecution over his role in the January 6 protests.

"What kind of man knows that a mob is armed and sends the mob to attack the Capitol and further incites that mob when his own vice president is under threat, when the Congress is under threat?" Cheney said.

"I have greater concern about what it would mean if people weren't held accountable for what's happened here," Cheney added.

"I think it's a much graver constitutional threat if a president can engage in these kinds of activities and the majority of the president's party looks away or we as a country decide, you know, we're not actually going to take our constitutional obligation seriously."

Thegatewaypundit.com reports: When asked if the January 6 Committee will possibly criminally refer Trump to the DOJ, Cheney responded in the affirmative.

"Yes," Cheney said. "The Justice Department doesn't have to wait for the Committee to make the criminal referral --- there could be more than one criminal referral."

Jon Karl played a previous clip of Cheney saying, 'Trump can never be anywhere near the Oval Office again' and asked her if her goal is to keep Trump from getting back into the White House.

"There's no question: A man as dangerous as Donald Trump can absolutely never be anywhere near the Oval Office ever again," Cheney said.

Cheney pushed back on Jon Karl and said the goal of the January 6 hearings is to "make sure that the American people understand what happened."

Sure it is.

When asked about Cheney's comments on ABC's "This Week" on the committee's possible criminal referrals --- and prosecution of Trump, Adam Schiff told host Margaret Brennan that he agreed with Cheney.
