WASHINGTON --- The FBI "verified" the authenticity of Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop in November 2019 and a federal computer expert assessed "it was not manipulated in any way," IRS supervisory agent Gary Shapley told Congress in explosive testimony released Thursday.

Investigators probing President Biden's son for tax fraud and other crimes were not given full access to the laptop's contents, however, Shapley told the House Ways and Means Committee during his May 26 deposition.

"The computer guy said that they could do a CSV list that shows when everything was created ... the whole discussion was about can we rely on this information on the laptop, is it Hunter Biden's? And their opinion was, it was, and it was not manipulated in any way," he said.

Shapley confirmed key details in the chronology of the laptop, whose existence was first reported by The Post in October 2020 but dismissed as a "Russian plant" by then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.

"In October 2019, the FBI became aware that a repair shop had a laptop allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden and that the laptop might contain evidence of a crime. The FBI verified its authenticity in November of 2019 by matching the device number against Hunter Biden's Apple iCloud ID," Shapley said.

The laptop's contents linked Joe Biden to his son's dealings, including in China and Ukraine --- contradicting his public claims he never discussed business with his son Hunter or brother James Biden.

Despite the FBI's internal corroboration, 51 former US intelligence agency leaders signed a pre-election letter saying that the laptop had "all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."

Most news outlets ignored the laptop's contents until well after Biden won the 2020 election, with the *Washington Post* and *New York Times* saying only in March 2022 that they had confirmed the authenticity of files.
