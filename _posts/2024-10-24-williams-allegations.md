Thirty-one years after Stacey Williams says she was groped by Donald Trump while Jeffrey Epstein watched, the 56-year-old writer, consultant and former *Sports Illustrated* swimsuit model went public this week with her allegation.

Williams, 56, told her story on a "Survivors for Kamala" Zoom call Monday night that was open to the public and that organizers said hundreds of people joined. It featured an array of women discussing their experiences with sexual violence and included actor Ashley Judd and Tarana Burke, who founded the #MeToo movement.

Williams, a registered Democrat who attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention and has been involved in liberal causes in the past, said on the Zoom call that her decision to come forward was in part related to the election.

"I figured it was time to share this, and I'm ready to win this election," Williams said on the Zoom call. "The thought of that monster being back in the White House is my absolute worst nightmare."

In an interview with NBC News on Wednesday, Williams said her decision to come forward was not made in conjunction with the Democratic Party. Asked whether she had had any communications with Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, she said, "None whatsoever."

Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt flatly denied Williams' allegation in a statement. "These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris Campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false," the statement said in part.

NBC News spoke to seven people who said they discussed the allegations with Williams between 2006 and 2022. All of them said they found Williams and her claim to be credible and consistent. Her allegation was first published in The Guardian and first broadcast by CNN.

Williams appears to be the first person to publicly allege sexual misconduct by Trump in which Epstein played a role. None of the dozens of women in Epstein's orbit whom NBC News has interviewed over the last seven years have accused Trump of misconduct that involved Epstein.
