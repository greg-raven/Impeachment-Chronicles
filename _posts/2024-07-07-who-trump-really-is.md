The American people have seen who Donald Trump really is

Folks --- The American people have seen who Donald Trump really is.

The delusion.

The lying.

The racism.

The xenophobia.

The admiration of dictators.

The utter cruelty.

Instead of properly handling the COVID crisis, Trump played golf and told people to inject bleach. Instead of accepting the 2020 election results, Trump riled up a mob that ransacked our Capitol and violently attacked law enforcement.

Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. And he is a threat to everything we hold dear.

It's our shared responsibility to defeat Trump once and for all and save our democracy --- but it will be impossible if supporters like you sit on the sidelines.

The MAGA Right has stockpiled millions of dollars to spread absurd falsehoods, and we must respond with strength.
