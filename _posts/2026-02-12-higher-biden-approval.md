President Trump has become so politically toxic that voters now say Joe Biden --- whose unpopularity forced him into early retirement --- did a better job as president, according to three new polls.

**Why it matters:** One year in, Trump has squandered virtually every advantage that won him the presidency. The White House has nine months to turn the ship around before a potential midterm wipeout for Republicans.

**Zoom in:** Three national surveys point to the same alarming trend for a president who's done everything in his power to erase his predecessor's legacy.

**Between the lines:** In the throes of Biden's 2024 polling collapse, his allies often complained about "Trump amnesia" --- the notion that voters had collectively memory-holed the chaos of the president's first term.

**Zoom out:** But even under the hood of Trump's polling, the silver linings are disappearing.

**What they're saying:** "If you know anything about Donald Trump, you know that he built his two presidential victories on winning voters [who are] without a college degree," Enten said.

**Reality check:** Don't mistake this for Biden nostalgia.

**The bottom line:** Gallup reports American optimism about the future has fallen to its lowest level in nearly two decades, with just 59.2% expecting high-quality lives five years from now.
