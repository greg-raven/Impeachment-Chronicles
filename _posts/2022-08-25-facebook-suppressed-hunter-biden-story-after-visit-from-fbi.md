There is growing evidence that the FBI ordered a crackdown of any investigation and any coverage of Hunter Biden’s laptop computer leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Click here to join Todd’s private Facebook group for Conservatives.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the FBI approached Facebook warning the platform about “Russian propaganda” ahead of the bombshell laptop story.

Zuckerberg dropped that bombshell news during an interview on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast.

Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook’s suppression of the New York Post’s reporting that exposed shady foreign business dealings of the son of then-candidate Joe Biden. The laptop was also filled with videos and photographs that were sexual in nature and others that portrayed the president’s son doing drugs.

“Basically, the background here is the FBI, I think, basically came to us – some folks on our team and was like, ‘Hey, just so you know, like, you should be on high alert… We thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that, basically, there’s about to be some kind of dump of that’s similar to that. So just be vigilant,’” Zuckerberg told host Joe Rogan.

Twitter completely banned users from sharing the New York Post story about the laptop.

Zuckerberg said Facebook users were “still allowed to share” the Post’s reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop even as their “third-party fact-checking program” was looking into whether it was misinformation, but acknowledged that the “ranking in [the] news feed was a little bit less” and that “fewer people saw it than would’ve otherwise.”

“By what percentage?” Rogan asked.

“I don’t know off the top of my head, but it’s- it’s meaningful,” Zuckerberg responded. “But we weren’t sort of as black and white about it as Twitter. We just kind of thought hey look, if the FBI, which I still view is a legitimate institution in this country, it’s a very professional law enforcement- they come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something then I want to take that seriously.”

Meanwhile, FBI whistleblowers have told Republican lawmakers that they were given strict instructions not to pursue any investigations surrounding the laptop.

“After the FBI obtained the Hunter Biden laptop from the Wilmington, DE computer shop, these whistleblowers stated that local FBI leadership told employees, ‘you will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop’ and that the FBI is ‘not going to change the outcome of the election again,’” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) wrote in a letter to the Inspector General.

“These new allegations provide even more evidence of FBI corruption and renew calls for you to take immediate steps to investigate the FBI’s actions regarding the laptop,” the senator wrote.

A government agency that tries to intimidate a private American company needs to be completely defunded and dismantled.
