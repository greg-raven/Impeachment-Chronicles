I just got back from Donald Trump's inauguration.

Trump talked about threatening war with Panama, but he didn't say one word about health care.

He announced to slew of executive actions that won't lower the price of eggs, won't make it any easier for you to buy a house, won't ease the panic that many families face each month when they try to pay their bills.

And the billionaires paid millions deaths sit in the front row in front of Trump's own cabinet nominees. That pretty much tells you everything you need to know about who's going to be calling the shots.

Look, I know that today feels like a gut punch and it's going to get worse. It's ugly, it's painful, or's not even surprising.

Donald Trump is great at distracting us with chaos.

Also, he can jam through terrible policies that will make hardworking people's lives worse and billionaires' lives better.

Us, we got to stay focused.

We got to hold the line against every hateful thing that Donald Trump tries to do. We've got to stay in the fight. 

So to everyone who is afraid of what happens next, I share your fears. But remember this, we are not powerless. What we do matters.

We are the people who are willing to fight for someone we don't know. Someone who may look different from us, someone who may live far, far away.

And when we fight, we can make a real difference.

Stay in this.
