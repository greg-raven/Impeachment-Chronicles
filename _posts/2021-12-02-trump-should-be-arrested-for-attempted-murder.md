<figure class="wp-block-embed is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">> [\#DonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DonaldTrump?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) should be arrested for attempted murder. He tried to infect &amp; kill [\#JoeBiden](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoeBiden?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) at the debate; by turning up too late to be tested, knowing full well he was positive; then screeched, sputtered, spit, and foamed at the mouth, hoping to infect Joe. He IS the devil.
