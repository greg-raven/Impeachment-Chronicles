Meet Christine Paige (D), an elected town board member in Potsdam, NY.

She thinks that Donald Trump being shot would be like "putting down a rabid dog."

She then called critics&#39; reaction to her disgusting comment, "foolishness."

> i have seen no credible proof that he's [Trump is] a human being. Maybe you know something we don't. To me, it would be akin to putting down a rabid dog.
