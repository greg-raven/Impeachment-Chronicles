So ... the reporters behind the 'blockbuster' Trump/Epstein letter have some 'splainin' to do.

You guys already knew that, but it's way shadier than Trump claiming the letter is fake and suing them.

The reporters on the story and their connection are interesting.

Take a look at this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am so proud of my brave, brilliant colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/khadeeja_safdar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@khadeeja_safdar</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/joe_palazzolo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@joe_palazzolo</a>, proud to live in a country where the founders put freedom of speech in the very first amendment, and proud to work at The Wall Street Journal.<br> <a href="https://t.co/eDlrvs4sKa">https://t.co/eDlrvs4sKa</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WSJ</a></p>&mdash; keachhagey (@keachhagey) <a href="https://twitter.com/keachhagey/status/1946010376543293567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote>

We'll see how proud she is of them when Trump sues the entire Leftist rag into bankruptcy.

About one of those colleagues ...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a> SCOOP re: <br>TRUMP'S ALLEGED EPSTEIN BDAY LETTER: The Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the "blockbuster" story alleging a letter Trump wrote to Epstein for his 50th birthday included some tawdry elements previously worked for Main Justice (his only prior reporting‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/Osa4jYsvV0">https://t.co/Osa4jYsvV0</a> <a href="https://t.co/BukMUhegt6">pic.twitter.com/BukMUhegt6</a></p>&mdash; Susan Crabtree (@susancrabtree) <a href="https://twitter.com/susancrabtree/status/1946181256020181176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote>

HOO boy.

There's more:

> ... experience listed in his bio). Main Justice was Glenn Simpson's wife's publication. Simpson founded Fusion GPS, which was paid by Hillary Clinton/the DNC (through Perkins Coie) to produce the Steele Dossier at the center of the Russian hoax against Trump.
>
> Both Glenn Simpson and his wife, Mary Jacoby, worked for the Wall Street Journal before launching their own enterprises. Trump is now suing the Wall Street Journal over the "blockbuster" letter story, arguing that it's bogus and that they never showed it to him so he could comment.

Once again, a connection to Hillary Clinton.

These dumfuqs never learn.

And yes, there's still MORE:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Want to dive even deeper? Mary‚Äôs daddy is Jon E.M. Jacoby. He‚Äôs a longtime executive at Stephens Investments in Little Rock. Guess who their attorney was? HRC, Rose Law.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well what do you know, another anti-Trump hit piece magically traces back to the Clinton-DNC-Fusion GPS slime trail. I mean, what are the odds?

We wouldn't be more shocked if we woke up tomorrow morning with our heads sewn to the carpet.
