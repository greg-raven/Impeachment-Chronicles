This feels like a false flag to me.

Why?

Shots fired. Secret Service NOT protecting the head of Donald Trump so he can get the photo op?

Like there’s 6 agents and NO ONE is protecting Trump’s head?

 They move slow af.

There’s no way this is real.

I agree with those saying this looks super fishy and potentially staged.

Authoritarians are known for staging false flags, planting goons to “attack” etc

Trump just came off another Victor Orban fest at Mar a Lago after all

This looks off and  smells staged

Claims that Trump shot at his rally are fake. It's a false flag to blame Democrats and Biden. Notice in the video how Trump grabbed his ear? He popped a fake blood capsule on his ear so it would look like he'd been hit. Then he pumped his fist in the air. BS!
