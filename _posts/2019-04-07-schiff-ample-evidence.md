House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Sunday said he thinks there is "ample" evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians but that it's not the same as conduct that rises to the level of criminality.

"Yes, there's ample evidence of collusion in plain sight. But that is not the same thing as proof of a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt," Mr. Schiff, California Democrat, said on CNN's "State of the Union."

Special counsel Robert Mueller didn't establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign, according to a summary of Mr. Mueller's report Attorney General William Barr released last month.

"I would defer to Bob Mueller's judgment, and I do," Mr. Schiff said. "But I think what we're talking about here is the difference between conduct that rises to the level of criminality and conduct that is deeply unethical, unpatriotic and corrupt that may not be criminal."

"I don't regret calling out this president for what I consider deeply unethical and improper conduct, not a bit," he said. "I think the moment that we start to think that we should back away from exposing this kind of malfeasance and corruption is a dangerous point."
