FEMA claims President Trump lied when he said migrants received funding that would have otherwise went to American citizens. FEMA's website says that, in 2023 alone, $425 million dollars was used for "assisting migrants" through the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP). FEMA also states it awards funds directly to the EFSP national board. Now, FEMA says it doesn't have enough funding to respond to hurricane season and victims of Hurricane Helene are suffering.

> The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is administered by the FEMA in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). SSP provides financial support to non-federal entities to provide humanitarian services to noncitizen migrants following their release from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The intent is to support CBP in the safe, orderly and humane release of noncitizen migrants from short-term holding facilities.
