- ‘If you do it repeatedly you’re putting yourself in the impeachment realm.’

RUSH EXCERPT:

HAYES: “What are you hearing from your constituents at this moment, congressman? Particularly I wonder after you use the word impeachment or talk about the possibility that if there was a violation of the sort of authority of our article three courts, that could open up to that. What is the feedback like to your constituents?”

CASTRO: “Everybody is obviously very concerned and nobody takes the idea of removing a president or impeaching a president lightly and no one should. It’s historically very significant and so it’s not a light hearted thing. It’s not a whimsical thing. At the same time, I think most people would agree that this president has behaved in an extraordinary manner. And ignoring or flatly disobeying a court’s order is also very significant and if you do it repeatedly you’re putting yourself in the impeachment realm.”
