Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), chairwoman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, claimed over the weekend Congress missed the opportunity to impeach President Donald Trump for “treason.”

“On my 3/2017 pinned tweet one can see \[Paul\] Manafort, \[Michael\] Flynn, \[Roger\] Stone, all of whom have been pardoned \[and\] more of them to come. They know the criminal \[and\] illegal relationship \[between\] Trump \[and\] Putin! They’re part of it! We missed our opportunity to impeach him for treason. \[New York\] can make up for it!” Waters tweeted Sunday.

“My tweets continue to reveal the dangers of Trump \[and\] his love of Putin! The Prez is LYING about China to protect Putin! Yes, Putin is responsible for the cyber attack!” the California Democrat wrote.
