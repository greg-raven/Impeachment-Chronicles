Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), chairwoman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, claimed over the weekend Congress missed the opportunity to impeach President Donald Trump for "treason."

"On my 3/2017 pinned tweet one can see [Paul] Manafort, [Michael] Flynn, [Roger] Stone, all of whom have been pardoned [and] more of them to come. They know the criminal [and] illegal relationship [between] Trump [and] Putin! They're part of it! We missed our opportunity to impeach him for treason. [New York] can make up for it!" Waters tweeted Sunday.

Waters accused Trump of adoring Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed Russia for hacking high-profile U.S. government targets.

"My tweets continue to reveal the dangers of Trump [and] his love of Putin! The Prez is LYING about China to protect Putin! Yes, Putin is responsible for the cyber attack!" the California Democrat wrote.

Waters' remarks follow Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accusing Russian-linked hackers of carrying out the cyberattack that involved several federal agencies and private businesses.
