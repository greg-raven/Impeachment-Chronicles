NEW: A challenge has been filed in federal court to have Donald Trump removed from the 2024 race under the 14th Amendment.

Mark my words: They'll claim they're doing this to "protect democracy."

Attorney Lawrence Caplan filed a challenge claiming Trump cannot legally be on the 2024 ballot because he "engaged in an insurrection."

"The bottom line here is that President Trump both engaged in an insurrection and also gave aid and comfort to other individuals who were engaging in such actions, within the clear meaning of those terms as defined in Section Three of the 14th Amendment," Caplan said in his filing. "Assuming that the public record to date is accurate, and we have no evidence to the contrary, Trump is no longer eligible to seek the office of the President of the United States, or of any other state of the Union."

They can't beat him so they have to cheat... again.
