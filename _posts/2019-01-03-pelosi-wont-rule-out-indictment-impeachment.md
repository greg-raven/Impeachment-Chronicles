- As she prepares to resume her role as House speaker, Nancy Pelosi told TODAY she isn't ruling out the idea that Trump could be indicted or impeached while in office.

Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn't rule out President Trump being indicted while in office, describing the topic as "an open discussion."

During an exclusive interview with TODAY's Savannah Guthrie, the House Democratic leader said it's possible that special counsel Robert Mueller could seek an indictment against the sitting president, despite Justice Department guidelines against such action.
