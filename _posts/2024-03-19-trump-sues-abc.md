George Stephanopoulos and ABC News are now being sued over the repeated lie that Donald Trump was "found liable for rape." Here is each instance:

- "Judges in two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming a victim of that rape."

- "Donald Trump has been found liable for rape by a jury."

- "I'm asking you a question about why you endorsed someone who‚Äôs been found liable for rape. Just answer the question."

- "It was a civil court that found him liable for rape."

- "... you're supporting someone who‚Äôs been found liable for rape."

- "Why are you supporting someone who‚Äôs been found liable for rape?"

- "You don't find it offensive that Donald Trump has been found liable for rape?"

- "Well, actually, what you‚Äôre doing is defending a man who's been found liable for rape. I don't understand how you can do that."

- "In fact, it has been shown to be rape. The judge affirmed that it was, in fact, rape. Donald Trump was found to have committed rape. That's just a fact."

- "So you've made it very clear you're comfortable with Donald Trump being found liable for rape ..."

- "So you're comfortable with it ... even though he's been found liable for rape?"
