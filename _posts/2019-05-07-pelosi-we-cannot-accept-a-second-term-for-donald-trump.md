Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the nation could not "accept" another term from President Trump if the country wants to remain "faithful" to the Constitution.

"We have to make sure — this will sound political but we have to make sure that the Constitution wins the next presidential election," Pelosi said at an event at Cornell University's Institute of Politics &amp; Global Affairs.

"We can't be worrying about well, how long is this going to take? Well, that will take as long as it does. And we will press the case so that in the court of public opinion. People will know what is — is right. But we cannot accept a second term for Donald Trump if we are going to be faithful to our democracy and to the Constitution of the United States," Pelosi said.

Pelosi's comments follow her telling the New York Times that she worries Trump will not accept the results of the election.

"We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that," she said.

"If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he's not going to respect the election," Pelosi said, recalling the 2018 election. "He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races; he would say you can't seat these people."

Pelosi added in her Tuesday comments that the Democrats needed to fight on all fronts to make sure Trump does not get elected again.

"So we have to operate on many fronts. We have to operate in the Congress, in the courts, and in the court of public opinion, and we must win the next election," Pelosi said.

Some of the progressive members of Congress have been pushing to get the whole Democratic caucus to support impeaching the president.

In March, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib submitted a formal impeachment resolution along with Rep. Al Green of Texas.
