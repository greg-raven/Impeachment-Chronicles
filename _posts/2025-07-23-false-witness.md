FALSE WITNESS‼️ Chris Pernell, an alleged doctor who recently appeared on CNN to paint a dark picture of President Trump's health, is reportedly not a practicing physician and instead works as an NAACP "Health Equity" director.

Pernell is also an "apostle" of a church whose leader called Trump the "antichrist" and has described white Evangelical Christians as agents of Satan.
