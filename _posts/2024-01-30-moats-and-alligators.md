Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA):

> So let's review the majorityâ€™s border ideas, that they've actually presented. Here they are:
>
> Donald Trump actually has said that he wants to build alligator moats along the border. That's one of his incredible ideas.
>
> Another idea that Donald Trump has promoted is he actually wants to electrify the border fence, and maybe even put some spikes on the border. That's another Donald Trump and MAGA-majority border idea.
>
> Another idea, which I'm not sure how well it would go, is he wants to actually bomb northern Mexico with missiles. That's another Trump idea.
>
> And finally, I think one of the ones that I think is the most grotesque, is suggestions that instead we should maybe just shoot migrants in the legs as they cross the border. So once again, the Donald Trump and MAGA plan is alligator moats, bombing northern Mexico, shooting migrants in the legs, and electrifying the fence, and putting spikes on them. That is the Donald Trump border plan.
