- ‘No matter what the Senate does – he’s impeached for ever’

Nancy Pelosi made a point to emphasize in an interview that Trump would go down in history as an impeached president. “He’ll be impeached for ever,” the House speaker said. “No matter what the Senate does. He’s impeached for ever because he violated our Constitution.”
