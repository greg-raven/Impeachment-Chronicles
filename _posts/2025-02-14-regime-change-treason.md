USAID said it was a charitable group. It wasn't. It was a tool for regime change. After 2016, it turned its guns inward. In 2019, a front group it created fabricated the evidence used by the CIA, moles in the White House, and House Democrats to impeach Trump. That's treason.

> USAID funded an organization that fabricated evidence which was used to impeach President Trump.

> The Deep State frequently funds regime change efforts abroad, but when it uses taxpayer money to undermine our own government, isn't that treason?
