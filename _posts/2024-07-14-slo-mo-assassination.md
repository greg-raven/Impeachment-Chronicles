Democrats have engaged in assassination porn for years. Literal assassination porn --- with leftists literally calling for a new John Wilkes-Booth to arise for bombing the White House and stabbing Trump-like Caesar. Snoop Dog did a video in which he shoots Trump himself. Watch the escalation of violent rhetoric:
