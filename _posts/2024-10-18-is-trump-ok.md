Donald Trump was scheduled to appear with former Fox News personality Dan Bongino for an interview on Friday, but a few minutes into their discussion, the ex-president abruptly ended the questioning.

Bongino, who has been supportive of Trump in the past, appeared to be confused.

"Can I get, Dan, off the rec ---, I gotta get going," Trump said.

"They're going crazy," Trump said, pointing off camera.

Among the bizarre topics Trump discussed was his empathy for former producer Harvey Weinstein, saying that he was treated badly after being found guilty on one count of rape and two counts of sexual assault in New York.

According to Trump, Weinstein got "schlonged. ... He got hit as hard as you can get hit."

Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign posted the video asking if Trump was "okay," and calling the ex-president "exhausted."

The super PAC No Dem Left Behind implied that Trump looked tired in the interview. They called him "Drowsy Don," saying he "needs a nap."

John Laprise, Ph.D. researcher who studies cyber warfare, among other things, posted on X, "Trump is unsuited to competing against Harris's high tempo campaign, and it is accelerating his decline. Remember: the presidency ages people. How long would he be president? It's looking doubtful that he could complete a full term in office."

This is an absolute lie. I produce Dan's show and just got off the phone with him. Trump stayed longer, took pics with the team, and signed a lot for charity, mostly going to the hurricane victims that Kamala's ignoring.
