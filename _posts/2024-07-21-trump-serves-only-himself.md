FOLKS, The choice this November is clear:

Joe Biden, who wants to build an America where everyone can prosper.

OR

Donald Trump, who is running to serve himself and his billionaire friends.

If elected, Trump plans to ...

- SIGN A NATIONWIDE ABORTION BAN
- GUT CHECKS AND BALANCES
- GIVE HANDOUTS TO THE ULTRA WEALTHY PAID FOR BY WORKING FAMILIES
- AND MUCH, MUCH MORE. ...

We must do everything we can to defeat him at the ballot box.
