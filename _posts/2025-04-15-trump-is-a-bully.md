"Exhibit A of a bully picking on the most vulnerable."

> Chris, you laid out the stakes ... uh ... very clearly, both for the country in terms of the Trump attack on freedom and in the case of Kilmar ... uh ... who is Exhibit A of a bully trying to start by picking on the most vulnerable.
> 
> So I promised that his wife and ... his wife and his family ... that I would do everything I could 24/7 ... uh ... to try to bring him home ... uh ... and that's why I am going to El Salvador.
> 
> Two ... two reasons.
> 
> One is to try to talk to government officials ... uh ... about his release.
> 
> This is a person who the Trump administration conceded ... uh ... had been erroneously abducted and sent to the prison in El Salvador, and to see about how he's doing what his personal welfare is, if I will be allowed ... uh ... to see him.
> 
> But, my view is, Chris, that we need to keep a spotlight on this injustice for both ... both for Kilmart and his family, but for all the other reasons you outlined in your opening ... uh ... statement.
