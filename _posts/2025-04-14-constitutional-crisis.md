- Trump's administration is only pretending to comply with the Supreme Court on the matter of a Maryland man it deported erroneously.

Between the path of outright defiance of the Supreme Court and following its order to "facilitate" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador's infamous Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT), the Trump administration has chosen a third way: pretending it is complying while refusing to do so.

During an on-camera Oval Office meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, whom the Trump administration has paid to imprison immigrants deported from the United States it claims without evidence are gang members, President Donald Trump deferred to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said the decision was Bukele's.

"That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us," Bondi told reporters. "That's not up to us. If they want to return him, we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane." Bukele, for his part, called Abrego Garcia a "terrorist," saying to a reporter who asked if he would return him, "I hope you're not suggesting that I smuggle a terrorist into the United States." He added, "The question is preposterous."
