In what might be one of the most well-timed rulings of all time, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals awarded former President Donald Trump $121,962.56 in attorney fees from adult film star Stormy Daniels.

The nearly $122,00 is in addition to the roughly $500,000 that she was ordered to pay him last year.

The ruling came down as Trump was in lower Manhattan, New York, on Tuesday afternoon and in the courtroom. He pleaded not guilty to 34 charges regarding allegations that he falsified business records related to Daniels’s hush money case.

Trump was indicted late last week by a Manhattan grand jury in a case involving his purported role in hush money payments to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, allegedly to keep Daniels quiet about an affair the two of them had in 2006.

The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling is separate from the Manhattan case.
