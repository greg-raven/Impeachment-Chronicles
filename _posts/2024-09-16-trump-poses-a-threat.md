Donald Trump incited a mob to sack the Capitol, a seditious crime without precedent in US history, and one he should spend the rest of his life rotting in jail for. No one should have anything but contempt for the authoritarian thugs trying to make this fact unmentionable

Trump poses a profound threat to the stability and, yes, existence of American democracy. He's a miserable fascist creep, his most devoted followers are miserable fascist creeps, none of them should ever have any role in the governance of this country

The fact that the miserable fascist creeps are sometimes endangered by the violent energies they themselves have unleashed on the country doesn't change the fact that they are the ultimate source of almost all our troubles

It's a dead giveaway that even while MAGA cries crocodile tears at being accurately identified as a mortal danger to Americans and American government alike, they CONTINUE to promote the disgusting, racist lies that are subjecting innocent Ohioans to a torrent of violent threats
