CNN's Jamie Gangel attacks Trump for saying "Fight! Fight! Fight!" after someone tried to murder him.

Literally, she complains about what he did 5 seconds after he was shot.

> I do want to say there was one thing, that when I watched the tape, I found odd ... uh ... --- because of all the [...] rhetoric --- is that after he was hit, ... uh ... former President Trump got up and said, 'Fight, fight, fight.' I think what we're hearing from people is that that's not the message that we want to being sending right now. We want to tamp it down."
