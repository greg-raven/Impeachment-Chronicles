- Trump questioning his price-lowering promises sparks anger

As a candidate, Donald Trump campaigned --- and won --- this year on the promise he would lower prices for Americans angry after the COVID pandemic's inflation brought steep price increases, but now he's backtracking, saying he's not sure he will actually be able to fulfill those vows. Outrage at Trump, and the people who voted for him based on that pledge, was palpable on Thursday.

As recently as Sunday, MSNBC reports, Trump insisted, "We're going to bring those prices way down."

On Monday, Fox News reported: "Pointing to high grocery prices, Trump says, 'I won an election based on that'."

But in his *TIME* magazine "Person of the Year" interview, Trump suggested he might not be able to lower prices as he promised to do. Appearing to remove himself from the equation, he declared: "It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard."

Sam Stein of The Bulwark and MSNBC noted via social media, "'Prices will come down,' Trump told voters during a speech last week laying out his vision for a return to the White House. 'You just watch: They'll come down, and they'll come down fast, not only with insurance, with everything.'"

The President-elect told *TIME* he would "like to bring them down" when asked, "If the prices of groceries don't come down, will your presidency be a failure?" but insisted if prices do not drop he doesn't think that will make his second term a failure.

On the campaign trail Trump repeatedly promised he would lower prices and inflation, as HuffPost reported Thursday:

"'We will end inflation and make America affordable again, and we're going to get the prices down, we have to get them down,' Trump said at a rally in September. 'It's too much. Groceries, cars, everything. We're going to get the prices down.'"

"'We will cut your taxes and inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America,' Trump said at a Georgia rally in October, reciting a line he used in speeches at several other events."

"Trump also specifically promised to get gas prices down: 'I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months.'"

Stein's post earlier Thursday morning quoting Trump saying "You know, it's very hard" to bring prices down set of an explosion of anger at the incoming occupant of the White House.

"Trump has already folded on prices. He has no plans to make life more affordable for the majority of Americans," declared Lindsay Owens, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Groundwork Collaborative.

"All of you idiots who voted for Trump over food prices should feel pretty stupid," journalist Roland Martin remarked in response.

Politico White House reporter Adam Cancryn responded to Stein: "Trump in Asheville in August: 'From the day I take the oath of office, we will rapidly drive prices down, and make America affordable again' 'Prices will come down. You just watch. They'll come down and they'll come down fast. Not only with insurance, with everything.'"

The *Washington Post*'s Aaron Blake added: "Trump on Sept. 23: 'Vote Trump, and your incomes will soar. Your net worth will skyrocket. Your energy costs and grocery prices will come tumbling down.'"

"Oh, Trump doesn't have a plan to bring down costs for Americans? I'm shocked," snarked Democratic U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal.

Tom Bonier, a veteran Democratic political strategist noted, "He's likely right, which is why the Biden record of increasing wages while slowing inflation has put our country on the right track, but of course no one could admit that until Trump won by running against inflation."

Ron Fournier, a business executive and former journalist asked, "Wait. He promised to bring them down. Did he ...

... lie?"
