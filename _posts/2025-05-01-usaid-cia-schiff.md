And here it is,

CONFIRMED: CIA Director Gina Haspel conspired with OCCRP, Adam Schiff, and USAID to topple the United States government in 2019.

Jesse Watters "You have this new piece on Substack that the USAID and the CIA helped orchestrate Trump's impeachment?"

Michael Shellenberger "It's a crazy story --- The House of Representatives impeached President Trump in December of 2019. Many people may may not remember that it was a CIA analyst who was left over from the Obama White House who wrote the memo that led to the impeachment. It was all based on hearsay. The person had not actually been in the room with Trump. 

"Nonetheless, this memo that he wrote relied heavily on a report done by an organization funded by USAID. In fact, its initial founding funding I mean, now it's $10s of millions of dollars had gone into this group called the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a name that's not very memorable, OCCRP, but it was basically created as an extension of the state department and then of USAID."

"In other words, the CIA attempted to topple the U.S. government in 2016 and 2019 and succeeded in 2020 --- all funded by USAID through the extortion of the American taxpayer.

Michael Shellenberger

> Yeah, I mean, Jesse, it's a crazy story. I mean, you might forget that, you know, the House of Representatives impeached President Trump in December of 2019. 
> 
> Many people may not remember that it was a CIA analyst who was left over from the Obama White House who wrote the memo that led to the impeachment. It was all based on hearsay, the person had not actually been in the room with Trump. 
> 
> Nonetheless, this memo that he wrote relied heavily on a report done by an organization funded by USAID. In fact, its initial founding funding, I mean, now it's tens of millions of dollars, had gone into this group called the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a name that's not very memorable, OCCRP. 
> 
> But it was basically created as an extension of the State Department and then of USAID. And as you know, Jesse, this is very serious to be involved in an effort to do regime change at home, as we've been discovering as the files have come out with what Elon Musk has been doing. 
> 
> We know that USAID was really about regime change abroad. It was a kind of public facing part, you know, regime change operation like CIA, but not covert moreover. Well, now you see a similar blowback, just like they did censorship abroad and brought censorship tools back home. 
> 
> They were doing this sort of thing abroad, creating a predicate essentially for Trump's impeachment. So I think it's just one of many revelations that we'll see coming out in the next few years. So USAID was involved in regime change abroad and here at home.
