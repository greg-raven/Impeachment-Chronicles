Don't be afraid to call things by what they are. MAGA is a terrorist organization, ICE is a secret police force conducting Ethnic Cleansing, Elon Musk is an oligarch, and Trump is a foreign backed coup d'Ã©tat figurehead. This is not an administration, this is a regime, and your country is occupied.
