Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, criticized the Biden Administration, claiming the 46th President had knowledge of the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago Monday evening.

“Joe Biden authorized this raid, make no mistake about it,” Eric Trump stated in an exclusive interview with One America News. “I understand how the system works better than anybody. And the FBI is now raiding the former president’s house, especially Donald Trump and especially Mar-a-Lago without Joe Biden giving the wink, wink, nod, nod. Make no mistake about that.”

President Donald Trump said the FBI blocked his attorneys from witnessing its actions during the raid in a post on Truth Social.

“Everyone was asked to leave the premises, they wanted to be left alone, without any witnesses to see what they were doing, taking or, hopefully not, ‘planting,’” Trump noted. “Why did they strongly insist on having nobody watching them, everybody out?”

Eric Trump said the raid was predicated on fear of his father.

“They want to slander Donald Trump,” he asserted. “They are petrified that he’s going to win again in 2024.”

Trump also invoked the Fifth Amendment while at a scheduled deposition with New York Attorney General Letitia James. The Attorney General scheduled the deposition to question the 45th President as part of a three-year civil lawsuit regarding the Trump Organization’s business dealings, specifically whether the business improperly inflated the value of its assets.

“\[James\] campaigned right before getting into the attorney general’s office,” said Eric Trump. “She campaigned on a promise. I’m going to go after Trump. I’m going to go after his children. I’m going to get him. I’m going to take him down.”

Despite the legal battles, Eric Trump said his father has raised more money in the last few days than he has in the history of his campaign.

“Over the last couple days, we have raised more money than ever before in the history of the campaign,” said Eric Trump. “Millions and millions and millions of dollars have come in. People are sick and tired of this stuff. They see exactly what’s happening. It’s a coordinated attack on all fronts.”

Eric Trump believes the raid has caused the American people to lose faith in the justice system.

“Everybody’s lost trust in the system,” Eric Trump said. “They’ve lost trust in the legal system, in this country. They’ve lost trust in not the men and women of the FBI.”
