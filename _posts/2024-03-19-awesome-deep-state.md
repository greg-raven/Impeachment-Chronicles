As America closes in on a major election, mistrust is brewing around the mysterious government entity that's now denounced in scary-sounding terms --- "the deep state" and "the swamp." What do those words even mean? Who exactly do they describe?

We went on a road trip to find out. As we met the Americans who are being dismissed as public enemies, we discovered that they are ... us. They like Taylor Swift. They dance bachata. They go to bed at night watching "Star Trek" reruns. They go to work and do their jobs: saving us from Armageddon.
