Actually, only some of the receipts since there are so many.

The Trump campaign has said the unsayable out loud: Democrats and the mainstream media have been <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/7b04b05d-a8ed-479c-b92d-5868a1f6873b">working overtime to demonize Trump</a>, and the inevitable result is that the more unhinged among them are being inspired to violence.

I've already written a couple of posts about the Democrats' incitement to violence, including instances above and beyond those cited by Trump. Conversely, Trump has listed a bunch that I haven't mentioned.

So let me reproduce his press release here:

<blockquote>
<p>
	Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump was the target of a second assassination attempt in as many months.
</p>
<p>
	Thankfully, the would-be assassin was stopped by the heroic action of law enforcement &mdash; **but make no mistake, this psycho was <a href="https://x.com/Surabees/status/1835440785841680830">egged on</a> by the rhetoric and lies that have flowed from Kamala Harris, Democrats, and their Fake News allies for years.**
</p>
<p>
	**Democrats used increasingly incendiary rhetoric against President Trump in the days, weeks, and months leading up to the two assassination attempts:**

That doesn't even include the dangerous rhetoric against President Trump spewed by deranged Democrats during the 2016 and 2020 elections, the impeachment hoaxes, and the Summer of Love.

	Democrats and the Fake News must immediately cease their inflammatory, violent rhetoric against President Trump &mdash; which was <a href="https://x.com/Surabees/status/1835440785841680830">mimicked</a> by yesterday's would-be asssassin.

<p>

</p>

Yesterday Twitter/X was awash in ridiculous posts, ranging from "it was a hoax" to "it's all Trump's fault." And it wasn't just left-wing wackos of the harridans of The View or the jerks on MSNBC. In newspapers across the country, pundits intoned in the fake "not in anger but in sorrow" tones of hypocrites that Donald Trump inspired people to shoot at him.

If only Trump had the decency to die, they wouldn't have to keep trying to kill him.

My favorite in that Overton mashup was Rick Wilson of The Lincoln Project fame, who hates Donald Trump because he violates democratic norms, calling for a bullet to be put into Trump's head.

Nice. Very respectful of American norms, Rick. Or how about this from yesterday?

I do think that many of these people are serious when they complain about Trump's rhetoric and totally unaware that they are the worst people in the world. They truly believe they are saving democracy.

Not all of them, of course. Many of them are just evil people, like Adam Schiff and Dan Goldman. I wonder what they would say if Republicans started calling for their "elimination?"

I don't want to find out. I just want them voted out of office and covered in the shame they so richly deserve.

As some people have pointed out, Donald Trump has now survived more assassination attempts this election cycle than Kamala Harris has given one-on-one press interviews.

This is the Democrats' vision of how "democracy" is supposed to work.
