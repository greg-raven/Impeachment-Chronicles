> In our investigation we saw strong evidence of collusion. The Republicans now are choosing to bury it. I don't know what you call it when the Russians make multiple approaches to members of the Trump family, the Trump organization, the Trump campaign, to offer and preview dirt on Hillary Clinton, where the candidate stands in front of a public crowd and says Russia you'll be rewarded if you hack her deleted emails, and then once Russia does it, the campaign doesn't report to law enforcement its prior contacts with Russia, they actually amplify through social media the candidate's own words what Russia hacked. I … I think that is … uh … that's clear collusion. But there's also evidence that the public has not yet seen that we think if we release our transcripts they would also find as.
