A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit that sought to keep former President Donald Trump off the ballot in Nevada under a 14th Amendment challenge that has succeeded so far in two other states.

U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro on Monday dismissed the lawsuit filed by a Texas man running for president, solely to file federal lawsuits in multiple states against Trump. Navarro's decision was not based on the merits of the 14th Amendment, but rather John Anthony Castro's lack of standing.

"In rejecting his political competitor standing argument, courts have found that Castro improperly manufactured his standing merely to file this lawsuit," Navarro wrote.

In fact, Navarro pointed to a prior quote from Castro.

"I'm not going to lie and pretend my candidacy is anything more than trying to enforce the United States Constitution, and that's what I'm here to do," he told a media outlet in October.

So far Colorado, by virtue of that state's high court, and Maine via the secretary of state, ruled that Trump should be removed from their ballots for violating the insurrectionist clause of the 14th Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court is taking up the case and arguments begin Feb. 8, same day as the Nevada GOP caucus.
