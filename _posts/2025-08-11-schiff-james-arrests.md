Former Department of Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, the infamous leaker who bragged about sabotaging the Trump Administration from the inside, admitted he is concerned that he and others, including Adam Schiff, will be prosecuted in a stuttering appearance on MSNBC.

Taylor penned a piece under an anonymous pen name in 2018 titled "I Am Part Of The Resistance Inside The Trump Administration," which was published in *The New York Times.*

He also wrote a book in 2019 detailing the efforts he and like-minded individuals were taking to sabotage a democratically-elected president.

He later admitted he was the author of the book while campaigning against Trump's re-election in 2020.

Taylor described himself as part of a group of senior officials within the Trump Administration who were working to thwart the president's directives.

He also claimed that several Trump appointees were actively working towards this goal, referring to themselves as the "steady state" rather than the "deep state."

Over the weekend, Taylor admitted he is nervous that he will be prosecuted for his role in what he himself described as a soft coup.

"Look, I am reasonably confident I did not commit treason against the United States of America, the country that I've served my entire career, but that's not really what they want to do," the former DHS official said.

"Whether it's going against me or Attorney General James or Adam Schiff, they want to go shine a light on these people in their lives and follow them as long as possible to find the traffic infraction that they can lord over them to make their lives very, very difficult," he added.

Taylor then predicted that Trump will soon "cross the Rubicon" and arrest individuals who said "nobody is above the law" when bringing controversial cases against their political opponents.

"And make no mistake, this is not for show. We're in only the early parts of this administration," he said.

"The president is under enormous pressure from the MAGA base to put these people in handcuffs. That's why for years he's talked about locking them up. They now want to see it. And I'm telling you, they are going to find it," he added.

Earlier this year, Trump removed a number of security clearances from former first-term officials and ordered a full review of their conduct.

According to Taylor, the order specifically references any security clearance provided to individuals at the University of Pennsylvania, where Taylor is a lecturer, "pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest."

"I think he's guilty of treason if you want to know the truth," Trump said while signing the order pertaining to Taylor.
