We have a president who has deployed the military, who are trained to kill our enemies --- not Americans, but our enemies --- are in our streets. It's the same week that we are going to have a military parade. Can you imagine that image that is going to be coming out ... uh ... of ... of our country? I mean I grew up ... uh ... in ... in ... in ... a dictatorship, and I don't even remember ever witnessing anything like that. To have a democracy, a beacon of hope for the world, to ... to now be turned into ... uh ... one of the ... you know ... one of the worst countries where ... where ... where the military are in our streets ... um ... without any regard for people's constitutional rights ... uh ... while our president's spending millions of dollars propping himself up ... um ... like a failed dictator with a military parade. Ah ... it ... it ... it ... it is really shocking and it should be a wake-up call for all Americans to say this is not the ... the ... the ... the country we ... we were born in. This is not the country we believe in. This is not the country our Founding Fathers imagined ... uh ... and this is not the country that is supported by our Constitution, our ideals, our values ... uh ... and we should all collectively be out in the streets rejecting ... um ... what is taking place this week.
