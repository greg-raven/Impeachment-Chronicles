Mayor Adams refutes Kamala Harris, says Trump is not a fascist as he urges Dems to "dial down the temperature" <https://trib.al/eNfjhTA>

Mayor Adams defended Donald Trump Saturday, slamming claims from Democrats that the Republican nominee is a "fascist" who could be compared to Adolf Hitler.

"I have had those comments hurled at me by some political leaders in the city; my answer is 'No'," said an embattled Adams, when asked about the criticism of Trump.

"I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like. I think, as I have called for over and over again, that the level of conversation, I think we can all dial down the temperature," added Adams, a moderate Dem currently facing federal corruption charges.
