Meet Erie County, PA City Council President Jasmine Flores @FloresForErie.

She posted this disgusting message blasting Trump supporters as racists and KKK members and suggests Black people who support Trump are "lost" and "embarrassing."

She needs to resign!!

> About 90% if not more of you red hat followers need to be honest with yourselves and acknowledge that WHITEHOOD you all own or were raised to own because of your SICK family history.
> 
> YOU ARE A RACIST and if your a person of color you need to stop hating yourself and find your roots because you are lost and your assimilation is showing and you are embarrassing the rest of us who have educated ourselves on the REAL AMERICANS HISTORY WITH ALL ITS BLOODSHED AND SLAUGHTER FOR BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE!!
> 
> That redhat is the new whitehoods for the KKK and I want to be wrong but when people show you who they are you have to believe them!!
