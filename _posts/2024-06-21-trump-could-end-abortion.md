Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) joins MSNBC's Ali Velshi to discuss how Democrats are seeking to repeal an 1873 law that Republicans could use to ban the mailing of abortion pills and her concern that a future Trump administration "led by MAGA extremists" could take away the rights of those in blue states as well.
