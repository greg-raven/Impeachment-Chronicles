- As President Biden grapples with an unwieldy crisis at the southern border, his likely 2024 rival has leveled many criticisms --- including some baseless and misleading claims.

Former President Donald J. Trump has drawn widespread censure after reprising a line that casts undocumented immigrants as "poisoning the blood of our country."

The remark underscored Mr. Trump's hard-line approach to immigration, which has been central to his platform since he made his first bid for president in 2015. If elected again, he has vowed to carry out mass deportations and enact other strict policies.

He and his Republican rivals have pointed to the surge of migrants at the southern border to make their political case. Some Democrats, too, have been critical of the Biden administration's approach toward immigration.

But even with legitimate lines of attack, Mr. Trump has at times turned to baseless and misleading claims during rallies in recent months.

Here's a fact check.
