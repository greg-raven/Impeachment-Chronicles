The chairman of the House judiciary committee Rep. Jerrold Nalder, a Democrat, was on all the Sunday morning talk shows following the conclusion of the special counsel investigation, and not only said Democrats would continue to look at impeachment, but that regardless of what the report finds, it's obvious that was "some collusion" between President Trump and Russia.

Nadler was speaking with CNN's Dana Bash, and she asked him about his willingness to accept the report.

"No member of the Trump campaign was charged with conspiring with the Russian government to influence the election," she said. "Do you accept that no member of the Trump team engaged in that kind of criminal conspiracy with Russia?"

First, Nadler said he doesn't know, because "we don't know what indictments are forthcoming from other investigations." He referenced SDNY, as Democrats have all weekend.

That's when he said that "obviously" they already know "there was some collusion."

"We know the president's son and campaign manager were involved in a meeting with the Russians to receive stolen --- what they thought was to receive stolen information --- information stolen by the Russians from the Democratic National Committee as part of the Russian government's attempt to help Trump in the election," he said. "That's the way the e-mail inviting them to the meeting put it."

"We know there's been collusion. Why there's been no indictments, we don't know," said Nadler.

Appearing later on the same program, Republican Senator Ted Cruz pointed to Nadler's remarks to say that the Democrats are definitely going to go ahead and impeach Trump no matter what.

"They fully intend to impeach the president and they don't care about the basis," said Cruz.
