Convict him, bar him from future service, have the prosecutors, the local prosecutors in New York pursue him, for the fraudster that he was before he ever became president, lock him up for the garden variety florence he did there, but don't give him that center stage, that dominant role in our national life, just down the street where Joe Biden is trying to heal this nation.

> The day after Joe Biden was sworn in as President, James Comey was calling for Trump to be thrown in prison and barred from running for office again.
