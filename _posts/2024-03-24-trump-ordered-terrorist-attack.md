Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot was a 'terrorist attack' and blamed Donald Trump for 'ordering' it.

Many claims have been made about Trump and the events on the day certifying the 2020 presidential election, but Rep. AOC saying the former president directed a terrorist attack against the U.S. government is a lofty claim.

Trump has not been formally charged with insurrection despite multiple cases and investigations against him claiming he incited the riots at the U.S. Capitol. There are two ongoing lawsuits related to Trump's election fraud claims --- one from the Department of Justice and one in Fulton County, Georgia.

Asked to make the argument against independent voters supporting Trump in 2024, AOC told CNN: 'Has there ever been a president, Republican or Democrat, that has been subject to this level of criminal charges, indictments and investigations? This is not about party. This is not about politics. This is about corruption and criminality.'

'We're talking about an individual who ordered essentially a terrorist attack on the Capitol of the United States in order to retain power,' she added in an interview with State of the Union host Jake Tapper on Sunday.

'That is not about being a Republican. It is not about being a Democrat,' the New York lawmaker said. 'It's about being unethical and ... unfortunately, this is the state that we're in.'

Democrats still claim that the Capitol attack should disqualify Trump from running for president in 2024.

But the former president was handed a win when the Supreme Court ruled earlier this month against a Colorado decision that attempted to remove Trump from the presidential ballot in the state.

The High Court said states do not have a right to decide which candidates can and cannot appear on their ballot.

The events surrounding the January 6 Capitol riot have garnered increased attention lately after the subcommittee reviewing the House investigation of the events that day found the panel suppressed evidence.

Specifically, the House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight Chairman Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) released the transcript of an interview with the man in charge of White House security detail.

Tony Ornato, according to the transcribed interview, confirmed other testimony that Trump did authorize deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C. during protests of the 2020 election.

The whole aspect of the National Guard authorization was central to the argument made by the House Select Committee on the January 6 Capitol Attack claiming that Trump did incite the riots that day.

Proof that he did approve deployment goes against the claims he didn't want protection for the Capitol.
