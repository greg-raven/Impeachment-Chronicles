Donald Trump is a vindictive and heartless man

Never before in American history has a president cut off SNAP during a shutdown, including Trump in his first term.

But now he is manufacturing a hunger crisis to bludgeon the American people so he doesn't have to fix healthcare.

> On Saturday, for the first time in American history, a vicious, heartless president is cutting off food stamps to hungry children, elderly who can't afford enough food to feed themselves, veterans who are down on their luck, all because he wants to use them as hostages, so that Democrats will stop fighting for people's health care.
>
> We can do both, provide better health care, and provide snap benefits to the tens of millions who need it.
>
> This president is a fucking liar.
>
> He says there's no money to provide food stamps 'cause of the shutdown.
>
> That's bullshit.
>
> His own agriculture department, said there's plenty of money.
>
> Every president, during shutdowns, has provided the money that's needed.
>
> Even Trump in his first term.
>
> He is bludgeoning the American people using the most innocent of victims, to try and go along with his cruel shutdown, which takes away health care for millions of Americans.
>
> He is the most vindictive politician America has ever seen, and the most heartless man America has ever seen in the presidency.
>
> We're fighting him every step of the way.
