And this is Trump's Deputy National Security Advisor K. T. McFarland:

"We now have black and white evidence." BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT that the FBI attempted the overthrow of the United States government on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016,

And, the CIA toppled the United States government on behalf of Joe Biden in 2020.

Now, issue the warrants, the arrests and the subpoenas.

Rough transcript:

McFarland
: Now have black and white evidence that the FBI interfered in the 2016 election. And then, when they failed to get their candidate elected, Hillary Clinton, then they just set out to destroy the Trump administration. So then go back and go up to 2020. It was the CIA this time that got involved in the 2020 election with those 51 former intelligence who talked about the 100 Biden laptop as total Russian disinformation. So they've gotten away with it for two elections. They're for sure going to get away with it. Try to get away with it in '24, right? Because there's no consequence. The difference is in 2024, the evidence is there. We now have the Durham investigation. We have all the congressional investigations. There is now hard evidence that there was election interference by the U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice. They've got to be terrified. Those individuals have to be terrified that a Republican president comes in in the 2024 election with a Republican attorney general. Investigates them and charges them all with the crimes they've committed over the last eight years.

Bartiromo
: Well, we'll see about that. You're right. There are questions around these elections because of this interference. Do you think there will be election interference then in '24?

McFarland
: Take it to the bank. They will absolutely interfere in 2024. We're not sure how, but they will absolutely interfere not only because they're not going to like whoever the Republican candidate is, but because they're going to protect their own hides. That's why they were talking to their own people and the whistleblower brought this up. Don't put anything on paper. Just tell us orally. They knew that they were doing stuff wrong. They knew that they were going to be liable for prosecution.
