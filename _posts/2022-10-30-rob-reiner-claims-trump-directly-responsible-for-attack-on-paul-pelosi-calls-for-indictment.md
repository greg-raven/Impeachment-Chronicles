Director, actor, and longtime Democrat activist Rob Reiner blamed former President Donald Trump for the recent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, Paul Pelosi, claiming it was “directly” tied to Trump challenging the legitimacy of the 2020 election.

In a tweet from Friday, Reiner accused the former president of “spreading The Big Lie for 2 years.”

Trump’s questioning of the election results, Reiner argued, “directly” inspired the recent attack on the Pelosi home.

“The violent assault on Paul Pelosi and the attempt to murder Speaker Pelosi is directly related to that Lie,” the Oscar-nominated director and actor wrote.

As a result, Reiner claimed, “Donald Trump is 100% responsible for this and Jan.6” and “must be indicted and never be allowed to hold office.”

“It is impossible to imagine someone this dim-witted. You are truly bewildering with all due respect of course,” wrote professor Gad Saad.
