Happy Halloween. Now, vote. Please.

Vote, like you understand that a DEM majority in the House and Senate means that we can begin to hold this President and his friends/family accountable for things like corruption and collusion; that it will help stop his racist, anti-LGBT agenda from adding to the damage already done.

Vote, like you understand what the word "nationalism" coming out of the mouth of the President of the United States signals. That it doesn't mean patriotism. That its undertones are white supremacy and ethno-nationalism. That it signals a backing away from a position as a world leader, a turning inward, a turning upon ourselves.

Vote, because I know you understand that the tax cuts they gave to the most wealthy among us have turned into huge debt that will be paid by the rest of us for generations to come.

Vote, because I'm sure you can see how the GOP rhetoric around health care is meant to deceive and that their planned agenda is to push us back towards a time when people life my wife, with a pre-existing condition, will not be able to afford insurance or the care she needs.

Vote, like you understand deep down that the lies this President tells over and over again (and that current GOP congresspeople don't push back against) are not frivolous, or funny, but intentional and strategic. Because you understand that these conspiracy theories that he has brought into mainstream discourse have real world consequences --- that they are designed to feed a way of thinking about "others" and a way of thinking about the world, that ensures his power. That those "others" will be a moving target and eventually they will come for you or someone you care about.

Vote, like you understand the rise of [fascism](https://www.gregraven.org/stories/definitionisms) and white nationalism is happening all over the world, and that if we cannot stop it here, it won't be stopped.

Vote, because our country, our values, and even our freedom depends upon it. Your children's lives depend upon it. And if you cannot see these, then because I promise you that as a LGBT person my rights depend upon it.

This isn't the time for old political party divisions. We are facing a wholly different kind of threat. And I implore you to vote like you understand this. For my friends who are conservatives, if you'd like a list of several long-time conservatives who are advocating for a similar voting strategy in this election --- let me know, and I can point you to them.
