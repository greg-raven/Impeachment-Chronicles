Sunday marks the first anniversary of the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. It also highlights just how evil and partisan the legacy media were on that fateful day and remain to this day. A perfect example is ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos and Martha Raddatz blaming Trump for the attempted murder of his life. Two lying, ever dutiful, Democrat hacks pretending to be journalists.

Have a look. (WATCH)

Shameless.

Posters pointed out that Raddatz evoked the 'bloodbath' quote in which Trump was talking about the auto industry. Raddatz lied and described it as a call to political violence.

That the legacy media has a 'greatest hits' of lies about Trump tells us everything we need to know about how dishonest and biased they are.
