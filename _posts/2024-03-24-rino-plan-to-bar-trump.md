Republican Representative Mike Gallagher, who represents the 8th Congressional district of Wisconsin, announced earlier this year that he would be retiring from the House of Representatives after serving his current term in Office.

On February 10th, 2024, Gallagher made the public announcement that he would not seek re-election to his position in 2024, further diminishing the slim majority Republicans currently hold in the House of Representatives.

Gallagher joins the ranks of 14 other House Republicans who have also announced that they will not seek re-election heading into 2024. That list includes,

- Debbie Lesko (AZ-8)
- Kay Granger (TX-12)
- Brad Wenstrup (OH-2)
- Michael Burgess (TX-26)
- Patrick McHenry (NC-10)
- Drew Ferguson (GA-3)
- Doug Lamborn (CO-5)
- Larry Bucshon (IN-8)
- Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-3)
- Greg Pence (IN-6)
- Jeff Duncan (SC-3)
- Matt Rosendale (MT-2)
- Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-5)

Yesterday Rep. Gallagher announced that he will be retiring from his position in the House earlier than expected, stating that he would officially resign his seat on April 19th, 2024. This places Gallagher on a list of several other Republican officials who have resigned from their positions in the House since the Republican takeover of the chamber in 2022.

That list of members includes,

- Ken Buck (CO-4)
- Bill Johnson (OH-6)
- Kevin McCarthy (CA-20)

In addition to these members, George Santos, who represented New York's 3rd Congressional district was expelled from Congress on December 1st, 2023. In total, the Republican Party has lost four members to retirement already.

The Republican Party currently holds just 218 seats in the House, while the Democrats currently hold 213. Colorado Representative Ken Buck officially vacated his seat on Friday, March 22nd, pulling the Republican majority down an additional seat.

Once Mike Gallagher departs on April 19th, the House Republican majority will have shrunk to just 217, the bare minimum needed to advance legislation in the body. As it stands, the Republican Party is just one retirement away from losing their majority in the House, and once again handing unilateral control of Washington D.C. to the Democratic Party and Joe Biden.

Revealing an apparent sinister nature to Gallagher's retirement, and the timing of the decision, Wisconsin law would afford a special election for Republicans to elect his replacement if Gallagher had just retired days earlier. If Gallagher had chosen to leave office anytime before the first Tuesday in April, a special election to choose his replacement would have occurred.

Since Gallagher has decided to retire on the 19th, the second Friday of April, his seat will remain vacated until it is eventually filled by the winner of the 8th district of Wisconsin in the 2024 Election.

Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has called out Gallagher for his decision to leave office after the deadline for a special election and has even called for Gallagher to be expelled from Congress before the looming deadline.

To understand the impact that Republicans losing their majority in the House of Representatives would have on the 2024 Election, we mustn't look further than the recent Supreme Court decision regarding former President Donald Trump's ballot access in the upcoming election.

The Supreme Court definitively stated in that ruling that Congress, not the individual States, had the right to bar an individual from access to the Presidential ballot. If Republicans can maintain their majority in the House, the prospect of Trump being removed from the Presidential ballot is practically impossible.

Should the Democrats regain control of the House before the 2024 Election, the prospect of President Trump being removed from the Presidential ballot becomes an almost certain possibility.

The Democrats already maintain a slight majority in the Senate, enough to pass whatever they like should Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats regain control of the House.

Once again, it appears that the largest threat facing former President Donald Trump is not from the Democratic Party, but from those within his own Party. When examining those who have decided to retire from Congress, and not seek re-election in 2024, we find many commonalities.

One commonality, present for nearly every departing member of the chamber, is one GOP megadonor who has worked to undermine President Donald Trump since he first launched his campaign for President back in 2015.

Paul Singer, billionaire hedge fund manager and co-CEO of Elliott Management, a firm responsible for over $50 Billion in assets. Singer is worth a reported $6 Billion. In 2016, the establishment Republican billionaire dumped $2.5 Million into Marco Rubio's failed Presidential campaign through a PAC called 'Our Principles.' See evidence of those donations below,

Singer's attempts to derail Trump did not stop after Trump's victory in the 2016 Election. Singer is also attributed with the initial creation of the highly questionable research included in the [Steele Dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}) through the *Washington Free Beacon* and Fusion GPS.

In the 2024 Presidential Election, Singer chose to donate to Nikki Haley's campaign through the SFA Fund PAC. The billionaire gave Haley an astounding $5,000,000 donation on December 18th, 2023. See evidence of that donation below,

[...]

Haley of course dropped out of the Presidential race on March 6th, 2024, less than 3 months after receiving Singer's astounding $5,000,000 donation.

Now that Singer's most recent efforts to bring down Trump have failed, some have speculated that he may be fueling efforts in the House to hand control to Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats.

6 of the 14 Republicans who have announced that they will not seek re-election in 2024 have taken past donation from Paul Singer. Those Representatives are Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Patrick McHenry, Drew Ferguson, Kay Granger, Blaine Luetkemeyer, and Greg Pence. See evidence of Singer's donations to these Republicans below,

Is Paul Singer influencing Republicans to retire from the House of Representatives in yet another attempt to derail former President Donald Trump?

By all measures, the push to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot has already begun, as top ranking House Democrat Jamie Raskin has already introduced legislation that would in fact bar Trump from the ballot in the upcoming Presidential election. All the Democrats need now is a simple majority in the House.

Further investigation of the four Republican Representatives that have retired from the House prior to the 2024 Election show us the Singer has donated to Mike Gallagher, Kevin McCarthy, and Ken Buck. There is only one Republican that has retired, or is retiring prior to the 2024 Election that hasn't taken money from Singer. See evidence of Singer's donation to Gallagher, McCarthy, and Buck below,

[...]

It's no secret that Paul Singer has been working to undermine Donald Trump since he first came down the Trump Tower escalator on June 16th, 2015. Could he be spearheading the mass retirement of GOP officials heading into 2024, ceding control of the House to the Democratic Party, and setting up Trump to be removed from the Presidential ballot prior to the election?

It surely seems like no coincidence that a majority of the members of Congress that are retiring, or have announced that they are not seeking re-election, have taken donations from Singer. Either way, the GOP establishment donor class obviously appears to be up to something.
