On January 20, 2017, Free Speech For People and RootsAction launched the campaign to Impeach Donald Trump Now to call for an impeachment investigation of President Trump for violations of the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The campaign expanded the grounds for impeachment following Trumpâ€™s continued and repeated abuses of power.

With this campaign, we received over 1.4 million signatures in support of an impeachment investigation of Donald Trump from people nationwide; supported passing seventeen local resolutions in cities across the country calling for an impeachment investigation; and worked with federal, state, and city lawmakers to hold Trump accountable to the law.
