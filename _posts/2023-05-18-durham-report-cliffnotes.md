Haven't read the #[DurhamReport]({% post_url 2023-05-12-durham-report %})?

OK. Here's the CliffNotes:

- The FBI and CIA KNEW Hillary was about to frame candidate Trump.

- Comey and Brennan BRIEFED Obama and Biden on her plot Summer 2016

- There never was ANY evidence of "Russian collusion"

- The U.S. Government nevertheless illegally spied on  the Trump campaign and the Trump White House

CONC: The Deep State is real, but Durham didn't have the balls to arrest any of its leaders or their masters, Hillary, Obama, or Biden.
