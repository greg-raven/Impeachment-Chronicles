- He has spent his life gaming the system, so it's no surprise that he can't accept defeat.

Donald Trump lost the election. He knows it. But he won't admit it.

He still hopes and believes that there is a way for the courts to erase enough votes to tip the election in his favor. This will not happen.

His legal challenges in swing states across the country are largely being met with defeat and setback. In court, you have to provide evidence. Lies, accusations and conspiracy theory don't cut it. Trump has spent his life gaming the system. It is unfathomable to him that this system can't be gamed.

In the end, Trump hopes to push his case to the Supreme Court, where he has seated three conservative justices. That is also not likely to be a winning strategy.

Trump believes he can use the judiciary as a weapon against the American people. The judiciary is not likely to allow itself to be used.

Barring that, he is committed to destroying faith in the electoral process itself. If he didn't win, he insists he must have been cheated because, in his mind, failure is not a possibility.
