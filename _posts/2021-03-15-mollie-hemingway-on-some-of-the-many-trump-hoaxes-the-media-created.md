<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">> Today's reveal that WaPo allowed a political opponent to anonymously invent Trump quotes is quite the story. But my favorite "anonymous" story remains "Anonymous"! That was when the NYT tried to suggest a disgruntled low-level staffer was Trump cabinet official or family member.

I love that story so much. Also, there were no repercussions for the NYT, other than the further loss of credibility. WP and CNN also ran puff pieces/hired the low-level dude. Good times.

Also that other outlets "confirmed" it. Fun.

And then pretended it was all NBD once they were exposed as hacks.
