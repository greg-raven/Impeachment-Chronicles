- The president should grit his teeth and repeat Hillary Clinton's line from 2016: "We must accept this result."

As it became clear that she would lose the 2016 election and news organizations called the race for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton spoke to her supporters.

"We must accept this result," she declared. "Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."

She did not boast that she had won 2.9 million more votes than Trump. She did not file lawsuits to try to reverse thin margins. And she did not offer evidence-free allegations of voter fraud --- as Trump did, even though he had won. Rather, she buttressed the norm in American electoral politics of the loser acknowledging the winner.

This norm is as traditional as it is wrenching for the losers. In conceding the presidential race in 1952 and sharing how he felt, Adlai Stevenson recalled what Lincoln supposedly said after losing an election: "He said he felt like a little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark. He was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh." Still, Stevenson resolutely called on his backers to support Dwight Eisenhower in the presidency.

In 2000, after the Supreme Court effectively ended Al Gore's quest for the presidency, Gore likewise admitted his heartache but urged voters: "I call on all Americans --- I particularly urge all who stood with us --- to unite behind our next president."

Trump might study the particularly eloquent speech by John McCain as he conceded to Barack Obama in 2008. McCain said: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together."
