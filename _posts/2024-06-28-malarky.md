I have never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.

I'm not kidding. Every single thing Donald Trump said is a lie. Every single one.

Here's the fact of the matter: Donald Trump is running a campaign of revenge and retribution. He wants to forever alter what we stand for as a country, to throw decency, honesty, and integrity all by the wayside. And he will hurt anyone to help himself.
