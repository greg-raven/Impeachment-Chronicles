WOW! No one can vote for Trump after this!

The new Jack Smith Documents, released by Judge Chutkan really say that leading up to the violence of January 6, 2020, the Trump campaign literally said "Make them riot" and "Do it!"

There is no saving Trump's chances after this.

Campaign staff literally were trying to create a riot in order to prevent Joe Biden from becoming President.

This is pure Evil!

Trump never issued an order for 10K troops. He was rebuffed by no one.
