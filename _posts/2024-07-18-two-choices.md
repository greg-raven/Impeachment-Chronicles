We have two choices for the future of our country come November.

1. We can let Trump win and enact his Project 2025 agenda: Ban abortion nationwide; give tax handouts to the ultra-wealthy while cutting health care and Social Security; and dismantle checks and balances.

2. OR, we can build on the historic progress President Biden and Vice President Harris have delivered over the past three and a half years and restore reproductive freedom across the country; build a tax system that supports middle-class and working families and makes corporations pay their fair share; and protect voting rights to uphold American democracy.
