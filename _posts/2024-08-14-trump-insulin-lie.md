Trump: "$35 insulin ... I did that. I did the insulin"

Fact check: This is a blatant lie. Trump did not cap insulin costs, Biden-Harris did for seniors through the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump's Project 2025 wants to repeal it, which would raise insulin costs for over a million Americans.

On May 26, 2020, President Trump announced that the price of insulin was being capped at $35.

Trump said the press wouldn't cover it and he was right.

During his speech he joked "I don't use insulin, should I be?" Except for Fox carrying a few minutes of his press conference, and a few MSM clowns using Trump's joke to disparage him, there was a complete media blackout on him lowering the cost of insulin. Nothing positive was said about it. That's how evil our media is.
