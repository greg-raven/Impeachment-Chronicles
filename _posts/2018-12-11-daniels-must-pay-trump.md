A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to pay President Trump about $293,000 in legal fees and sanctions after her defamation suit against him was dismissed.

Mr. Trump's lawyers had requested about $389,000 in legal fees, but the judge, S. James Otero of United States District Court in California, said the number of billable hours was "excessive" and cut the amount by 25 percent to about $292,000. Writing that Ms. Daniels "is already being deterred from filing meritless defamation claims," Judge Otero ordered her to pay $1,000 in sanctions.

In a statement, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, Charles J. Harder, said, "The court's order, along with the court's prior order dismissing Stormy Daniels' defamation case against the president, together constitute a total victory for the president, and a total defeat for Stormy Daniels in this case."
