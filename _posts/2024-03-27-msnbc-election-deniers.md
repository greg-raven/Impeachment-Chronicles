Nicolle Wallace said that MSNBC would NEVER allow an election denier on their "sacred airwaves."

Irony. Look it up. It's a noun.

You were more than happy to allow an election denier on your sacred airwaves when the election results put Trump in the Oval.

No network gaslights on "election denial," like the cable "news" outlet that brought us the Russian collusion hoax every single day for nearly a decade.

> The irony is that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president. He did not win the election without help from Russia. You will see this. And he knows he's illegitimate. Every time you mention it, he freaks out, and that's karma. ---  Tom Arnold
