CEO's and business execs hoping to dissuade Donald Trump from enacting what they and many economists believe will be ruinous tariffs are finding he won't budge and that has them scrambling to find a way to get through to him.

According to a report from the business-friendly *Wall Street Journal,* the president-elect's proposal to hit U.S. allies with huge tariffs in the belief it will help American consumers are even catching some members of his inner circle by surprise.

As the *Journal*'s Brian Schwartz wrote, "Trump isn't budging" before adding, "So far, executives are facing setbacks as they canvass Trump's aides for advice on how to influence the president-elect's next steps. Trump is largely acting on his own, leaving his incoming team of advisers with few opportunities to shape his thinking."
