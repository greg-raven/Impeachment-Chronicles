> Barry Moore: Mr Durham I appreciate you being here today. Sobering, I think, is a pretty good word I think that's a good description of what we're talking about when I read your report and as we talk about it when I'm in the district very often one of the major concerns is a weaponization of Investigations in the Department of Justice against certain people in our society and so um yes or no did the FBI Place significant Reliance on information given to them by President Trump's political opponents I'm sorry can you just repeat that one did the FBI did they place significant reliance on information given to them by President Trump's opponents the crossfire hurricane investigation um well the fisa in particular the Pfizer and Carter page the bureau had concluded itself absentee dossier they wouldn't have been able to Did the dossier come from Trumps political opponents establish probable cause did the dossier come from president Trump's political opponents it was funded by the Clinton campaign um in the in the DNC um so in that that degree yes it came that's how it was paid for can you connect the dots between the Trump I mean I'm sorry between the Clinton campaign and the investigation of the FBI um you know we we were investigating did investigate you know what was what was behind that investigation how did it get started was it properly predicated as a full uh investigation by the FBI and why did it then continue even after director Mueller had found a lack of sufficient evidence concerning conspiracy Mr Durham is that is that what you call sobering would that be sobering to you it's sobering to me in connection to this investigation as the FBI the people who Did the FBI fail to take action were involved in the crossfire herd cane investigation ignoring exculpatory information uh discarding information that was inconsistent with the investigative narrative with using information in this instance from the [Steele dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}) to establish probable cause to electronically surveil the United States citizen who happened to be a a Naval Academy graduate those things are sober to me oh I would agree with that um did the FBI ever fail to make a delay taking action in an investigation involving Hillary Clinton um I did that wasn't um well there's a portion of the report that relates to the disparate treatment so did the FBI um a delay there are three instances that are identified in the report where the FBI's investigative efforts uh were considered considerably more disciplined than was the case uh with respect to Mr Mr Trump more discipline you mean by us Did the FBI give the Clinton campaign a defensive briefing and let me move Mr I don't run out of time did the FBI give the Clinton campaign a defensive briefing um they gave in a particular manner the FBI gave Mrs Clinton's represent legal represent Representatives uh DB free of defensive nature yes why wasn't the same done for the Trump campaign and president Trump we um explored that during the course of the investigation the um what we learned and set out in the report that it would appear from at least what we were told to very little uh thought went into whether they should give anybody in the Trump campaign a defensive briefing and they didn't a lot of thought went into giving Hillary Clinton's campaign a defensive briefing apparently but not president Trump in one instance the I think you're referring to um the submission of a fisa application and that matter against the foreign interest was premised on them giving a Did the Clinton campaign collude with the Russians defensive briefing to Mrs Clinton and some other uh political Mr Durham is it safe to say that the Clinton campaign colluded with the Russians to accuse Donald Trump of colluding with the Russians I could not phrase it that way I could say is that the Clinton campaign funded the information that showed up in the in the dossier the Clinton uh uh campaign funded the information that's put together concerning an alleged secret Communications Channel between Trump and Alpha bank which was presented to the FBI through Mr Sussman so yeah there are those things that definitely occurred in the evidence establishes that.
