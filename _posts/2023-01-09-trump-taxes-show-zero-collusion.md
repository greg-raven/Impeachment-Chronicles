Remember how many Democrats clamored for President Donald Trump’s tax returns to be released because they believed it would show proof that he was somehow in cahoots with Russia and Vladimir Putin?

**Now his tax returns have been obtained and are public. And …**

**There’s nothing about Russia. At all.**

BASEDPolitics’ Brad Polumbo writes, “Yet what’s more important is what Trump’s tax returns did not show: any corrupt connection to Russia. Democrats for years suggested that the real reason Trump wouldn’t release his tax information was because it would show that Putin had something on him.

Just for an example, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in 2018, ‘The president has refused to release his tax returns, but these bizarre actions that he has taken, which seem so to indicate that President Putin has something over President Trump, something personal, and it might be financial. We need to see the tax returns.’

Well, now we have them, and Trump’s tax returns show nothing of the sort. It’s not exactly new at this point for Democratic warnings about Trump-Russia collusion to later prove baseless, but it’s still worth revisiting just how far removed from reality their claims were.”
