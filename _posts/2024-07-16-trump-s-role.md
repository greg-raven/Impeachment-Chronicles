One party and one party alone is responsible for rise in political violence: The horrific nature of the shooting should not stand in the way of the media's examination of Trump's role in the degeneration of our political discourse. They should press him and fellow Republicans to explain (and renounce) talk of televised military tribunals for Jan. 6 committee members and threats to execute the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump's newly announced running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) --- who on Saturday made the unsupported accusation the shooting was "not just some isolated event" --- should be scrutinized as well.
