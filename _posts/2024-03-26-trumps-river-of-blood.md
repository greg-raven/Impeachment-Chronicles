The Francis Scott Key Bridge spanned the lower Patapsco River.

Crazy coincidence ...

On 3.24 Trump mentioned the flag at Trump National Golf Club. The plaque under it says, The River of Blood." Trump's timestamp was 8:47 and Q847 = "WATCH the water."

Note Francis Scott Key wrote word of our national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner."
