This was a vote to kill a resolution impeaching President Donald Trump. It was the second vote on impeachment since the President took office. As expected the resolution did not move forward, losing with 355 votes to kill the resolution. Most members of both parties voted to kill the resolution, with 66 Democrats and no Republicans voting for impeachment proceedings to begin.

The previous vote, which was a month earlier, was killed with 364 representatives voting to kill the resolution.

This vote was related to a resolution introduced by Rep. Al Green \[D-TX9\] on January 19, 2018, H.Res. 705 (115th): Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, of high misdemeanors.
