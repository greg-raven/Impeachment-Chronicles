Actor Martin Sheen on Donald Trump: "You are the biggest nothing in the world. Stop listening to all these people around you, these sycophants, who are encouraging you to be your non-human self. Get in touch with that humanity. Stop fussing with your hair. Speak from your heart and start being human. That's what you were made for, not golf."
