Trump continues to use threats of oppression, extortion and misinformation to bully Canada. He isn't negotiating in good faith. In fact, he isn't negotiating anything at all. He's threatening our sovereignty. Tariffs will just go away if we agree to be the 51st state. We will have lower taxes. We will have military protection. We will have better healthcare. These are false promises and deliberately misleading. They amount to extortion, fraud and oppression. We would be giving up something of great value for lies-fraud. 

He will continue to push the lies in order to confuse and divide us as a nation. He thinks we are stupid. He thinks Greenland and Denmark are stupid. He thinks Panama is stupid. With those countries he threatens military and economic force. He has stopped short of threatening Canada with force, so far. 

His statements and actions through social media are bordering on Foreign Interference. His defenders can no longer say he's just joking. Seventy percent of Americans DO NOT support him but they are silent. Trump uses fear to silence his own people and he's exhibiting the same methods towards us. He's trying to make us fearful. 

We need to stand up to a bully. It's unbelievable that it's our historical closest ally. Trump is totally untrustworthy. His personal exploits and illegal dealings are well documented. He can't erase that. He has become the USA's biggest liability. We can't ignore the parallels to other dictators, especially fascist dictators from history. We can't rely on the free trade relationship we have both benefited from.

We have far greater rights and freedoms today in Canada than they do in the USA. We don't need to fear imprisonment or retribution for criticizing our leaders. He disparages members of the media who are critics. He uses language unbecoming of a head of state to belittle others. He says he likes Canadians but doesn't know Jack shit about Canada or its people. He hates anyone who stands up to him. He will tantrum against us. He will impose tariffs because he has backed himself into a corner.

The whole world's economy will suffer. We won't be alone. We will find new markets for our products and services and reduce our reliance on the USA. We are resilient and don't need Donald Trump telling us anything. He's a liar, dumb as a post and everyone knows it. His own people are dumbfounded by what he spews about natural disasters, water from a big valve up north somewhere. He continues to repeat the same garbage over and over. He's trying to do that with us. Don't buy into his bullshit. It's a myth that he's a great negotiator or businessman. Great negotiators don't use threats of harm. They seek new ways for both parties to win.

Add Columbia to the growing list.

Add in a few more warning signs for American citizens. He crowned himself King yesterday and signed an EO giving him and the AG exclusive authority over interpretation of the law. Above the Supreme Court turning it useless for the American people who trust it.
