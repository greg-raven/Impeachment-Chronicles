In an interview with “CBS Sunday Morning” host Jane Pauley that aired Sunday, former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton talks about the recent accusation that President Trump inappropriately pressured the president of Ukraine for information about the Biden family’s deals with an energy country in that country.

“I can’t deny that a big part of me cares deeply about what is happening in the country, and I have a big fear the damage that is being done to our future, to our values, our institutions, and try to think of ways I can help those who are on the front lines of the fight,” Clinton said.

“I believe he knows he’s an illegitimate president,” Clinton said of Trump. “He knows. He knows that there were a bunch of different reasons why the election turned out the way it did. And I take full responsibility for those parts of it that I should. But hey, it was like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation, and losing to a corrupt human tornado. And so, I know that he knows that this wasn’t on the level. I don’t know that we’ll ever know everything that happened. But clearly, we know a lot, and are learning more every day. And history will probably sort it all out. So of course, he’s obsessed with me. And I believe that it’s a guilty conscience (insomuch as he has a conscience).”

“And I don’t care who you’re for in the Democratic primary or whether you’re a Republican, when the president of the United States, who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution — and by that, defend the American people and their interests — uses his position to in effect extort a foreign government for his own political purposes,” she said. “I think that is very much what the founders worried about in ‘high crimes and misdemeanors.’”
