Meet Dan Whitfield.

He’s running for US Senate in Arkansas against @TomCottonAR.

Dan said the world would be a better place if the bullet would have killed Donald Trump last Saturday.

Dan deleted the tweet. And then he deleted his X account.

Don’t ever let Dan get away with this.

Remember his face and make him famous.

He should be criminally charged as well.

Make this go viral so this piece of shit is unemployable and unelectable for the rest of his sorry life.

> Political violence, any violence, is not acceptable and should be condemned, but it still would have made the world a better place.
