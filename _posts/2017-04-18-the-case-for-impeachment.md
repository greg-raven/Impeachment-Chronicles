<figure class="wp-block-image">![The Case for Impeachment](/assets/The_Case_for_Impeachment.jpg)<figcaption>The Case for Impeachment</figcaption></figure>***The Case for Impeachment*** is a non-fiction book by [American University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University) Distinguished Professor of History [Allan Lichtman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Lichtman) arguing for the [impeachment of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_impeach_Donald_Trump). It was published on April 18, 2017, by [Dey Street Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dey_Street_Books), an imprint of [HarperCollins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins). Lichtman predicted to *[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post)* that after ascending to the presidency, Trump would later be impeached from office. He developed this thesis into a set of multiple arguments for Trump’s predicted impeachment.

Lichtman argues in the book that Trump could face impeachment for reasons including: complicity of conspiracy with foreign governments, [crimes against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity) for the U.S. neglecting [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming), and violation of the [Foreign Emoluments Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Emoluments_Clause) of the constitution barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. He provides the reader with an overview of [Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections) and [links between Trump associates and Russian officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials), asserting such ties could be used in [efforts to impeach President Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_impeach_Donald_Trump). He uses the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal) as the backdrop to compare Trump’s reactions to criticism with those of [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon) during [Nixon’s impeachment process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Richard_Nixon). The author discusses [assertions of sexual misconduct against Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations), and delves into some of [his legal affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump) stemming from them. Lichtman places the [Donald Trump and Billy Bush recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_and_Billy_Bush_recording) within a larger context of public degradation of women.

The *[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times)* gave *The Case for Impeachment* a positive review, writing: “Lichtman’s powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations.” *[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post)* called it “striking to see the full argument unfold.” *New York Journal of Books* recommended it as a resource, “if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought.” *[CounterPunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CounterPunch)* characterized the work as “a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act.” *[The Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper))* gave the author praise, writing: “Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year.” [CBC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News) consulted law scholars who said Lichtman’s impeachment prediction was unlikely, especially with a Republican-controlled [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives).
