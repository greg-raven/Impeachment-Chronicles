It seems to me that people aren’t quite getting how close we are to a crisis of legitimacy 1/

A hostile foreign power helped put Trump in office. That’s not at all in question except among Trump sycophants 2/

The questions, instead, are (a) whether people close to Trump, perhaps Trump himself, actively colluded in that intervention 3/

or (b), whether ppl close to and possibly including Trump have had other dealings with Russia that effectively make them foreign agents 4/

If Trump uses the power of his office to shut down investigation into these questions, we have to assume that there’s something there 5/

And in that case, how can anyone consider this presidency legitimate? Very, very scary — and could happen within days 6/
