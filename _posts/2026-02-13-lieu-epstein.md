Rep. Ted Lieu hurled wild rape accusations against President Donald Trump in a fiery exchange with Attorney General Pam Bondi Thursday --- but failed to mention that his claims stem from an unhinged source.

At a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Epstein files, the deluded Democrat cited an unclassified FBI document that outlined unverified claims from an anonymous man, who worked as a limo driver in 1995.

The man claimed he picked up Trump and overheard him in the backseat speaking on the phone to someone he repeatedly called "Jeffrey" and made references to "abusing some girl."

The limo driver claimed he was "a few seconds from pulling the limousine over on the median and within a few seconds of pulling him out of the car and hurting him."

But Lieu, who represents California's 36th District, failed to disclose the troubling origins of the allegations --- the man behind the FBI report is Dan Ferree, who's posted hundreds of politically charged and anti-Trump memes to his Facebook account, including one recent image that looks like the president in a casket.

Ferree has openly admitted on social media to being the anonymous FBI caller prior to Lieu's mention of the report, and has accused Trump and his administration of stalking him over the years. He also rattled off wild claims during an interview on The Opperman Report.

Ferree, in the report he made to the FBI, said he later met a young girl who told him she had been raped by Trump and Epstein at a "fancy hotel."

Ferree also claimed, without evidence, the young girl who made the rape allegations was found years later with her head "blown off," and that officers on the scene didn't believe it was a suicide. He said the coroner later ruled it a suicide.

Lieu has since re-posted only two of three pages from Ferree's full statement to the FBI. The third page shows Ferree rambling about the Oklahoma City Bombing and a drunk Hillary Clinton.

Lieu's office has not yet responded to a request for comment.

He and Bondi traded blows at the hearing Thursday, with the congressman at one point accusing her of lying under oath after she claimed there was no evidence Trump ever committed a crime.
