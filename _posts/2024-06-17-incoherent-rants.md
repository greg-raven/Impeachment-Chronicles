Last month, Dr. Jill Biden was a very welcome guest on "The View" and she was looking forward to the debates to show how much experience Joe has and how Donald Trump can't put a sentence together.

"You need to see Trump, and you need to see the President, and you need to see the differences. And my husband's, and you're gonna see how smart he is and the experience he has," Biden said. Trump "can't put a sentence together."

The projection is strong with the Left. *The Atlantic* just did a piece on Trump going off on a rant about sharks, while "Biden may gaffe, but he lives in reality." This is the guy whose son died in Iraq and whose Uncle Bosey was shot down in World War II and eaten by cannibals, right?

Last week, CNBC featured a reporter who told us about a meeting Trump had had with a bunch of CEOs, and how they were startled by his inability to keep a straight train of thought.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reporter: I just spoke to a number of CEOs who met with Donald Trump. They thought they may support him at first, but they walked out of the meeting saying he was remarkably meandering, could not keep a straight thought, and was all over the map <a href="https://t.co/M6rx7i4zX0">pic.twitter.com/M6rx7i4zX0</a></p>&mdash; Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/BidenHQ/status/1801791667793469759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2024</a></blockquote>

[...]

Rep. Ted Lieu apparently heard the CEO story and weighed in Monday:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear CEOs: Part of your job is to know the news. If you are “startled” when you see Trump’s incoherent rants in person, then that means you are consuming far too much right wing news.<br /><br />Go outside your biased information bubble. Your company and your country will thank you for it. <a href="https://t.co/d5w01rkkDj">https://t.co/d5w01rkkDj</a></p>&mdash; Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) <a href="https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/1802755089192648907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
