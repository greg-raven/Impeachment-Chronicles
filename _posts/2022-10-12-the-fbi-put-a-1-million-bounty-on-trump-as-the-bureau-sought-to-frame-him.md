- James Comey and his crooked cronies at the bureau were so desperate to topple Trump that they put the equivalent of a a taxpayer-funded bounty on the president's head to frame him.

An FBI analyst dropped a bombshell in a Virginia federal courtroom Tuesday: the FBI secretly offered Christopher Steele $1 million if the ex-British spy could only corroborate his phony dossier that accused Trump of colluding with Russia.

Think about that. James Comey and his crooked cronies at the bureau were so desperate to topple Trump that they put the equivalent of a a taxpayer-funded bounty on the president's head to frame him. Bring us the evidence, and we'll make you rich!

The stunning revelation came on the first day of the criminal trial of Igor Danchenko who is charged by special counsel John Durham of lying to the FBI about the dossier.

Of course, Steele could not possibly prove any of his dossier because it was pure fiction —totally made up. And the FBI knew it almost from the outset because Steele's primary source told them so. Early on, Danchenko confessed to the FBI that the document was utterly bogus. He admitted to agents that it was nothing more than a devious composition of rumors, innuendo, multiple hearsay, and outright lies.

Declassified documents show that the entire collusion smear was invented by Hillary Clinton herself in the summer of 2016 and funded by her campaign. Independently, the agency had already debunked it but told no one.

The falsity of the dossier didn't stop the FBI from exploiting it to go after Trump with a vengeance. The fraudulent document fueled the FBI's dishonest investigation against the president. The bureau also used the dossier to lie to FISA court judges to gain intrusive and lawless warrants to spy on Trump associate, Carter Page.

Comey, Andrew McCabe and others assured the court under oath that the dossier was credible and that Steele was reliable when they knew that both were untrue. Indeed, Steele had been fired from the FBI payroll for lying, but that vital fact was carefully concealed from the court.

Steele wasn't the only one the FBI was funneling money to. Danchenko was also a paid informant for the bureau to drum up evidence against Trump, even though the Russian national was considered to be a counter-intelligence threat. Again, Comey's machinations demonstrates just how frantic top officials at the FBI were to bring down Trump —doling out large sums of taxpayer money to nefarious people to support their spurious case against him.

The mainstream media that convicted Trump in the court of public opinion for more than two years are still serving up a goulash of lies. On NBC News Tuesday, a reporter told viewers that the FBI never used the dossier in the Trump probe. That is utterly untrue, as demonstrated by the FBI's own records that have been made public. So, don't expect truth, accuracy, and fairness from the Trump-hating media in its coverage of the Danchenko trial.

As the testimony unfolds we can expect to learn even more about the malevolence, depravity, and corruption that has infected the FBI. Stay tuned.
