This is really, really bad

Our democracy is at immediate risk, and history is repeating itself. What Donald Trump and Elon Musk are doing mirrors the actions of past authoritarian regimes. It took just 53 days for Hitler to dismantle Germany’s democracy. 53 days. He used executive orders, erased marginalized groups, and silenced opposition --- while too many stood by and did nothing.

Trump’s executive order erases transgender and intersex people from legal recognition --- just like Hitler erased Jewish and trans people from legal records before persecution began.

Elon Musk now has access to the U.S. Treasury’s financial system --- just like Putin’s oligarchs seized control of Russia’s wealth to consolidate power.

Trump is erasing vital medical information from our government and silencing opposition --- just like Hitler suppressed science and banned opposing views.

Trump is dismantling government agencies, firing oversight officials, and gutting institutions like USAID and the Department of Education --- just like Hitler replaced government officials with loyalists to eliminate accountability.

We are on day 15, and we are running out of time. We have to make change, or our democracy will be gone.
