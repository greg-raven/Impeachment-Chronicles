"Sleazebag." "Shifty."

Folks, it's Representative Adam Schiff. That's what Donald Trump has called me for investigating his effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in exchange for military aid against the Russians.

While I may not use such choice language to describe the former president, I believe that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime, both at home and abroad.

Around the globe, democratic countries are terrified of the prospect of a second Trump presidency.

And they should be.

During his time in the White House, Trump cozied up to Vladimir Putin and he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. And to this day, he threatens to abandon our NATO allies if there is an attack against them in Europe.

We must defend democratic ideals and continue fighting for our hard-fought freedoms. In Congress, my colleagues and I are working to protect our democracy, save our planet, and make the economy work for everyone --- and we're going to need President Biden in the Oval Office to get the job done.
