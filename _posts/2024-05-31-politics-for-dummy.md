The 34 felonies are all one count, split up into 34 because Cohen was paid back over time --- every time a check was written, FELONY, check was written into the ledger, FELONY, etc.
Best of all Trump wasn't informed of the "underlying crimes" until closing arguments, so he never received due process.

Oh and the only witnesses, Daniels and Cohen, said on the stand that this did and didn't happen, and Trump did and didn't know any of this was even happening.
