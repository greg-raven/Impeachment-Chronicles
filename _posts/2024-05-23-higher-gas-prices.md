- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized former President Trump ahead of his campaign stop in Bronx

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., put former President Trump on blast, alleging that he would enable foreign energy producers to "price gouge" if he wins re-election.

In an interview on Spectrum News NY1 on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez reacted to Trump's upcoming rally near her district and potential messaging the former president may use to appeal to the working-class borough.

"I suspect there's going to be a lot of out-of-towners there," the Democratic representative said. "And listen, we have a big, diverse city, I'm sure someone will be showing up supportive."

Ocasio-Cortez turned the conversation to gas prices, warning voters that Trump would raise prices by enabling foreign energy producers to "price gouge."

"But even on the economic point, we just saw that the former president met with oil executives last week saying, hey, you give me $1 billion, and I'll make sure that you get the policies that are favorable to raising gas prices and making sure that a lot of these companies continue to price gouge without proper oversight or regulation," Ocasio-Cortez said.

"And so the idea that we'd be bringing those down when he's cashing in for those same folks that are bringing those prices up, I think is a little bit suspect," she added.

**Sticker Shock at the Pump**

AOC's words of warning came after AAA announced last week that gas prices were over 50% higher than when Biden was inaugurated.

The national average for a gallon of gas was nearly $3.62, up from $2.39 on Jan. 20, 2021, when the president was sworn in. Gas prices for part of 2022 --- a year after Biden took office --- were double what they were when he was sworn in. According to AAA, the highest recorded average price for unleaded gas in the U.S. was on June 14, 2022, when a gallon cost consumers $5.016.
