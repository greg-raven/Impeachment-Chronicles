**What Is Duty To Warn?**

Duty To Warn is an association of mental health professionals who believe it is their ethical duty to warn the public that Donald Trump is psychologically unfit to be president. His thinking is distorted, his words are dishonest, and his behavior is unstable, dangerous and destructive. Thus, we advocate his removal under the 25th amendment.

**The Professionals Behind the Movement**

Clinical psychologist, John Gartner, PhD, is the main organizer of the movement. He is joined by mental health professionals from various field including, but not limited to, psychiatry, psychology, medicine, public health, public policy, and social work; in every field, professionals have been voicing their concern about the president's instability.

Dr. Bandy X. Lee, a Yale psychiatry professor, organized the meeting that started it all. "The Goldwater Rule is not absolute. We have a 'Duty to Warn,' about a leader who is dangerous to the health and security of our patients." She has formed a coalition by that name, and it now comprises almost 800 mental-health professionals who are "sufficiently alarmed that they feel the need to speak up about the mental-health status of the president."

**We Are Mandated Reporters**

Mental health professionals are mandated reporters with a duty to warn our patients and the community around us if we feel there is a potential danger. In this case, we collectively feel there a a duty to warn the public of the threat Donald Trump poses both to our nation and the planet.

It is our duty to notice when an individual is a danger to themselves and/or others.

**The 25th Amendment**

The movement stands in solidarity with those calling for the invocation of the 25th Amendment. Our online petition continues to gather signatures.
