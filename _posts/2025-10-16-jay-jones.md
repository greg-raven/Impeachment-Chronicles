As attorney general, I can't wait to see Donald Trump in court.

Donald Trump, President Trump, Donald Trump.

Because Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump.

I will see Donald Trump in court to hold him accountable.

Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Trump administration, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, President Trump, President Trump, Donald Trump. Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump.

Jason hangs out with Donald Trump at MAGA rallies.

I will see Jason Miyares and Donald Trump in court as your next attorney general.

People have been victimized by Donald.
