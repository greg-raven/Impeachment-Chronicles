Democratic Representative Dan Goldman sparked MAGA Republicans' fury by calling for former President Donald Trump to be "eliminated."

Goldman, who represents New York's 10th Congressional District, discussed Trump's connection to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol during a Sunday appearance on MSNBC's Inside With Jen Psaki. A former prosecutor who worked on Trump's first impeachment inquiry in the House, Goldman has been a staunch critic of the former president's handling of his defeat in the 2020 election.

He told Psaki that Trump should never hold office again because of his denial of the 2020 race's results, which a federal indictment says led to efforts to overturn the election, culminating in the January 6 riot. But Goldman's choice of words brought widespread condemnation on social media.

"His rhetoric is really getting dangerous, more and more dangerous," the congressman said. "And we saw what happened on January 6. When he uses inflammatory rhetoric now, and his recent Truth Social posts, is incredibly, incredibly scary for anyone that might be trying to work in government.

"It is just unquestionable at this point that that man cannot see public office again. He is not only unfit. He is destructive to our democracy, and he has to be eliminated," Goldman said.

Newsweek reached out to Goldman's office and Trump's campaign for comment via email.

On Monday morning, Goldman apologized for the remark in a post on X (formerly Twitter).

"Yesterday on TV, I mistakenly used the wrong word to express the importance for America that Donald Trump doesn't become President again," he wrote. "While he must be defeated, I certainly wish no harm to him and do not condone political violence. I apologize for the poor choice of words."

Still, the comment drew a backlash from conservatives on social media.

"Leftist Congressman @RepDanGoldman says Trump 'has to be eliminated.' In the least, Goldman should be investigated by the Secret Service for this threat," posted Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

Conservative activist Benny Johnson wrote: "Democrat Congressman Dan Goldman just said President Trump 'has to be eliminated' while simultaneously ranting about his 'dangerous rhetoric.'"

Conservative commentator Rogan O'Handley said: "Time to Censure Dan Goldman for inciting violence against a President of the United States."

Charlie Kirk, CEO of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, posted: "If a Republican went on TV and said that a Democrat presidential candidate needed to be 'eliminated' they'd be raided by the FBI within hours. Donald Trump is facing half a millennia in prison for saying people should 'fight.'

"Instead, Dan Goldman alludes to the assassination of Donald Trump and does so with zero consequences and zero fear of any consequences," Kirk said.
