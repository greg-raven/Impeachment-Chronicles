Marc Elias is terrified President Trump called him out by name during Friday's visit to DOJ.

Elias previously deleted his 𝕏 posts (except one) because he's afraid of being tried for treason.

He was at Perkins Coie until 2021 and helped Hillary Clinton with her Russia hoax.

> You know, I mean, Donald Trump, you are an election denier.

> You are a threat to democracy.
>
> You tried to overturn a free and fair election in 2020.
>
> You spread lies and disinformation about our voting systems and the security of elections.
>
> And you continue to lie to the American people almost every single day.
>
> And I am going to continue to say that.
>
> You can't go after some corporate overlord, as Brian said, you know, Democracy Docket is published on its own platform, and you're not going to intimidate.
>
> So, you know, we're going to continue to do what I need to do as a responsible citizen.
>
> I'm going to speak out against tyranny.

> I'm going to speak out against Donald Trump's lawful actions, and I'm going to litigate.

> And I'm not going to be cowed or back down from that.
