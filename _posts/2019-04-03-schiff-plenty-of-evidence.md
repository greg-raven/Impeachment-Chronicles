Rep. Adam B. Schiff continued to double down on his claims Wednesday that there was "plenty of evidence of collusion" between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia but added it wasn't enough for special counsel Robert Mueller to pursue charges.

"There is plenty of evidence of collusion and corrupt co-mingling of work between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but I fully accept that as a prosecutor that he couldn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt [of] that crime," the California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" show.

The chairman listed evidence of collusion, including a meeting between Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a Russian connected to political consultant Konstantin Kilimnik, Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting, and Mr. Trump asking Russia to find his political rival Hillary Clinton's "missing emails."

Mr. Schiff has received multiple calls for his resignation as chairman of the House intelligence committee following Mr. Mueller's investigation not supporting his news media statements of collusion.

The president even said Mr. Schiff "should be forced to resign from Congress!"

Mr. Schiff said, "The attacks by Mr. Trump and his allies are not particularly new, and I expect they will continue as long as he is in office, but I am going to continue to do my oversight job."

The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to give Chairman Jerrold Nadler the power to subpoena Mr. Mueller's full final report and all of his investigative materials after Attorney General William P. Barr released a four-page summary of the findings.
