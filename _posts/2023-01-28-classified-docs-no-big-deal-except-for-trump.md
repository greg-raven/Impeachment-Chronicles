The Deep State FBI influenced *New York Times* is attempting to build their case on classified documents. They are no big deal unless you are President Trump.

The TGP [The Gateway Pundit] has reported since the Deep State FBI's illegal raid on President Trump's home that he had every right to take with him the documents he wanted to take per the Presidential Records Act. He also had the ability to classify or declassify any documents he wished while President.

[…]

The Deep State FBI mouthpiece *The New York Times* does not see it this way. In a report yesterday, they say the following:

> Classified documents keep turning up in the homes of former presidents and vice presidents. First, law enforcement found hundreds of them in Donald Trump's home. President Biden's aides recently gave back classified documents that were found in his office and home, dating to his time as vice president and senator. And last week, Mike Pence's aides found classified documents in his home.
>
> After all of these discoveries, the National Archives asked former presidents and vice presidents yesterday to look through their personal records for any documents that should not be there.
>
> The three cases have important differences. Notably, Trump resisted efforts to retrieve the documents, while Biden and Pence returned them voluntarily. But they have all raised the public's awareness of what has long been a government phenomenon: Current and former officials at all levels discover and turn over classified documents several times a year, The Associated Press reported.

This is blatantly false. President Trump was working with the FBI. He allowed them on his property. He kept his documents under lock and key with security and Secret Service all around his Mar-a-Lago. He opened his doors to their review. This is why attorney Davis says the FBI's actions were unnecessary.

On the other hand, Biden had top-secret classified documents in his home, in his garage, and in the China-backed U Penn Biden Center since when Biden was Obama's corrupt VP. This is at least six years. When these documents were handed over to the FBI it was not immediate or quick in any way.

We don't know about Pence.

Biden's documents were top-secret. They should have never left government protection yet they were found in Biden's possession.

The *New York Times* goes on to state that we classify too many documents.

> In many agencies, officials "face no downsides for over-classifying something," said Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School and former special counsel at the Pentagon. "But if you under-classify something, really dire consequences could come for you."
>
> So officials tend to play it safe. Of the more than 50 million documents classified every year, just 5 to 10 percent warrant the classification, Hathaway estimated, based on her experience at the Pentagon.

The Times says there are hazards to overclassification.

> So what's the harm? Experts say there are several potential dangers to over-classification.
> For one, it keeps potentially relevant information from the public, making it harder for voters and journalists to hold their leaders accountable. One example: Starting in the 2000s, the U.S. ran a highly classified drone program to identify, locate and hunt down suspected terrorists in the Middle East and South Asia. The program's existence was well known, and the destruction it caused was widely reported. Yet elected officials, including members of Congress briefed on the program, could answer few questions from constituents or reporters about it because the details were classified.
>
> Over-classification can also make it difficult for agencies to share information with others, whether they are other U.S. agencies or foreign partners. "There are national security concerns — in terms of information not getting shared that should be," said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program.
>
> And, of course, the recent discoveries show how hard it can be to track all of these classified documents. "We've just overloaded the system," Goitein said. "And that makes slippage inevitable."

**See – the Deep State says that we classify too much. That is why Biden did nothing wrong. But orange man is bad.**
