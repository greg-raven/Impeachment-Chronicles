Former special counsel Robert Mueller testified today before the House Judiciary and House Intelligence committees.

We’re wrapping up our live coverage of his testimony.

In case you missed it, here are the key takeaways from his second hearing:

- Right at the outset, Mueller clarified the most significant exchange from earlier in the day. He did not intend to say they did not indict the president because of the OLC guidance. He clarified that he meant that because of the OLC guidance there was no decision either way on whether to indict.
- In clear and concise language, Mueller reminded the panel why his investigation matters: “We spent substantial time ensuring the integrity of the report understanding that it would be our living — a message to those who come after us. But it also is a signal, a flag to those of us who have some responsibility in this area to exercise those responsibilities swiftly and don’t let this problem continue to linger as it has over so many years.”
- Mueller defended not subpoenaing the President because of the prolonged process to fight over it. But asked if anyone tried to stop it, Mueller made clear they could have subpoenaed if they wanted to.
- Mueller condemned the behavior of the President and his son. On Trump’s WikiLeaks comments, Mueller said “problematic is an understatement.” An exchange between Donald Trump, Jr. and WikiLeaks was “Disturbing and also subject to investigation.” At another point, to Rep. Demings, he refused to weigh in on the President’s credibility. He also said he felt the president was not truthful in his written answers.
- A tantalizing exchange: Asked to assert there was no evidence of an allegation that Paul Manafort met with Julian Assange, Mueller did not deny it, but rather said “ I’m not sure I agree with that assumption.” (Manafort attorney declined comment)
- Will this ever be put to rest? Asked about Michael Cohen going to Prague, Mueller said he can’t get into it. (The report said he did not go and Cohen testified in February that it never happened.)
- During Robert Mueller’s testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee he deferred or declined to answer questions from members of Congress at least 82 times, according to a CNN analysis. Of those instances Mueller referred lawmakers to his report at least 4 times.
