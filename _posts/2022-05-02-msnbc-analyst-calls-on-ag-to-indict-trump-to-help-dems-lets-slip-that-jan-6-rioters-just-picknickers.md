Democrats need a little help from their friends in the U.S. Justice Department to avoid electoral disaster in the November elections because the outcome could be no picnic for the radical left.

That appears to be the implication from a Democrat operative during a Saturday morning conversation on ratings-challenged MSNBC in the video clip embedded above.

Democrat pollster and analyst Fernand Amandi appeared on "The Cross Connection" to react to a previous segment that featured DNC chair Jaime Harrison. Amandi apparently was not enamored with the Democrats' strategy for the midterms as Harrison had presumably outlined.

Amandi started off in hardly establishing his credibility by claiming that, heading into the November vote, "Democrats have a wonderful story to tell." He then went to apparently imply that the DOJ must indict top GOP leaders rather than just January 6 U.S. Capitol "picknickers" to enable the Dems to retain control of Congress.

To give you an idea where he is coming from, for example, back in December 2021, Amandi described Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a "wannabe dictator, dangerous Florida man."

Before explaining how federal prosecutors could "help" his party maintain control of Congress, Amandi told Cross that the Democrats' "truthful" election message should be something as simple as, "the Democrats saved your life, they saved your job, they saved the economy. And now they they're trying save the democracy from a Republican Party that no longer believes it."

The political/media establishment has been rolling out, without evidence, the coordinated talking point about GOP threats to democracy for quite some time now.

"If they stick to that type of message, which is the theory of the case, the facts of the matter of what happened, and they get a little help...taking that message all around the country, letting the race be dictated on those terms, I think that is a winning message," Amandi continued.

"Let me talk about the help, though, because it's one thing to try to disqualify a Republican Party that no longer believes in democracy, but you need a little bit of help. If the Department of Justice and the Attorney General Merrick Garland do not start issuing indictments, not to the front-line Proud Boys and picnickers on January 6th that led an insurrection, but to the perpetrators of the crime, the members of Congress who we now know through text messages were plotters, the ringleaders at the top echelon of the Republican Party, up and to and including the Republican President Donald Trump, voters are not going to believe that --- they're gonna just think it's just political back and forth.

"The Justice Department needs to hold the perpetrators accountable. The Democrats need to tell the truth. We saved your life, we saved your job, we're trying now to save the economy, and to save democracy," he concluded.

Given how every agency under the Biden administration has adopted a radical leftist agenda, including a "ministry of truth" (i.e., a censorship entity) in the Department of Homeland Security, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that the DOJ could issue some politicized, election-eve (or before) indictments for some GOP luminaries.

There has already been an attempt by the left to kick some Republican lawmakers, such as U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, off the ballot pursuant to Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Coincidentally or not, HBO "Real Time" host Bill Maher has also complained about the lack of federal indictments for the so-called insurrection, although he also admitted that voters are more concerned with issues such as immigration and inflation.

According to the Associated Press, however, "More than 200 people have pleaded guilty and more than 80 have already been sentenced," as of mid-February, for J6-realted offenses. Many were charged, however, with trespass-related crimes.

Many pundits are play-acting on TV for a check, but it is fascinating how those who have undermined democracy publicly bemoan mythical threats to it. It's similar to how conspiracy mongers accuse others of spreading conspiracy theories or misinformers lament misinformation.

In his remarks, Amandi may have been referring to an unverified, alleged text message from Greene to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sometime after January 6, 2021, in which she allegedly alluded to other Republicans saying that Trump should invoke martial law.

Later in the segment, in a form of extreme projection that liberals have become known for, he reportedly claimed that "If these Republicans gain control, they will not give it back. We will lose democracy. And if you lose democracy, it's not the sort of thing that you get back. Oh well, we'll hold it out in five years. You may not see it again in your lifetime in this country."

Greene says she doesn't recall the message, which her lawyer has described as innocuous. MAGA stalwart Greene has also repeatedly insisted that the "bipartisan" J6 committee in Congress should also investigate the Antifa/BLM-related riots during the summer of 2020.

Although MSNBC is admitting that Dems have an uphill reelection battle, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has separately implied that the helpful authorities could declare a public health emergency this fall to enable the Democrats to distribute more mail-in ballots for the vote.
