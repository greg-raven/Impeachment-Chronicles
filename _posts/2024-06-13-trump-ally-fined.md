Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is lashing out after the European Union fined his nation nearly $215 million for violating the EU's asylum and migration laws.

The EU's Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, said in a statement issued Thursday that Hungary must pay a lump sum of 200 million euros and a penalty payment of 1 million euros per day of delay for failure to comply with a judgment derived from "deliberately avoiding the application of a common EU policy as a whole," adding it constitutes "an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law."

Orban, a right-wing lawmaker and strong ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, called the fines "outrageous and unacceptable" in a post on ùïè, formerly Twitter.

"It seems that illegal #migrants are more important to the Brussels bureaucrats than their own European citizens," Orban said.
