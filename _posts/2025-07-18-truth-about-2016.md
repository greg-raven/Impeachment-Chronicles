- New Evidence of Obama Administration Conspiracy to Subvert President Trump's 2016 Victory and Presidency

- ODNI News Release No. 15-25

WASHINGTON, D.C. --- On Friday, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard revealed overwhelming evidence that demonstrates how, after President Trump won the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, President Obama and his national security cabinet members manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork for what was essentially a years-long coup against President Trump.

- In the months leading up to the November 2016 election, **the Intelligence Community (IC) consistently assessed that Russia is "probably not trying ... to influence the election by using cyber means."**

- On December 7, 2016, after the election, talking points were prepared for DNI James Clapper stating, **"Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome."**

- On December 9, 2016, **President Obama's White House gathered top National Security Council** Principals for a meeting that included James Clapper, John Brennan, Susan Rice, John Kerry, Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe and others,** to discuss Russia.**

- After the meeting, DNI Clapper's Executive Assistant sent an email to IC leaders tasking them with creating **a new IC assessment "per the President's request"** that details the "tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election." It went on to say, "ODNI will lead this effort with participation from CIA, FBI, NSA, and DHS."

- **Obama officials leaked false statements to media outlets**, including The Washington Post, claiming, "Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election."

- On January 6, 2017, **a new Intelligence Community Assessment was released** that directly contradicted the IC assessments that were made throughout the previous six months.

After months of investigation into this matter, the facts reveal this new assessment was based on information that was known by those involved to be manufactured i.e. the Steele Dossier or deemed as not credible. This was politicized intelligence that was used as the basis for countless smears seeking to delegitimize President Trump's victory, the years-long Mueller investigation, two Congressional impeachments, high level officials being investigated, arrested, and thrown in jail, heightened US-Russia tensions, and more.

> "The issue I am raising is not a partisan issue. It is one that concerns every American. The information we are releasing today clearly shows there was a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government. Their goal was to subvert the will of the American people and enact what was essentially a years-long coup with the objective of trying to usurp the President from fulfilling the mandate bestowed upon him by the American people," **said DNI Tulsi Gabbard.** "Their egregious abuse of power and blatant rejection of our Constitution threatens the very foundation and integrity of our democratic republic. No matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. The American people's faith and trust in our democratic republic and therefore the future of our nation depends on it. As such, I am providing all documents to the Department of Justice to deliver the accountability that President Trump, his family, and the American people deserve."

Americans will finally learn the truth about how in 2016, intelligence was politicized and weaponized by the most powerful people in the Obama Administration to lay the groundwork for what was essentially a years-long coup against President Donald Trump, subverting the will of the American people and undermining our democratic republic. Here's how:

For months preceding the 2016 election, the Intelligence Community shared a consensus view: Russia lacked the intent and capability to hack U.S. elections.

But weeks after President Trump's historic 2016 victory defeating Hillary Clinton, everything changed.

On Dec 8, 2016, IC officials prepared an assessment for the President's Daily Brief, finding that Russia "did not impact recent U.S. election results" by conducting cyber attacks on infrastructure.

Before it could reach the President, it was abruptly pulled "based on new guidance." This key intelligence assessment was never published.

The next day, top national security officials including FBI Dir James Comey, CIA Dir John Brennan, and DNI James Clapper gathered at the Obama White House to discuss Russia. Obama directed the <abbr title="Intelligence Community">IC</abbr> to create a new intelligence assessment that detailed Russian election meddling, even though it would contradict multiple intelligence assessments released over the previous several months.

Obama officials immediately leaned on their allies in the media to advance their falsehoods. Anonymous IC sources leaked classified information to the *Washington Post* and others that Russia had intervened to hack the election in Trump's favor.

On January 6, 2017, just days before President Trump took office, DNI Clapper unveiled the Obama-directed politicized assessment, a gross weaponization of intelligence that laid the groundwork for a years-long coup intended to subvert President Trump's entire presidency.

According to whistleblower emails shared with us today, we know Clapper and Brennan used the baseless discredited [Steele dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}) as a source to push this false narrative in the intelligence assessment.

These documents detail a treasonous conspiracy by officials at the highest levels of the Obama White House to subvert the will of the American people and try to usurp the President from fulfilling his mandate.

This betrayal concerns every American. The integrity of our democratic republic demands that every person involved be investigated and brought to justice to prevent this from ever happening again.

I am providing all documents to the Department of Justice to deliver the accountability that President Trump, his family, and the American people deserve.
