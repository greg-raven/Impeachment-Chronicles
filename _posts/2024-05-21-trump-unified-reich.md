Last night, Donald Trump posted a video to his social media suggesting a second term for him would create a "unified Reich" in America.

Folks, listen ... this is serious stuff. And it's not like Trump's echoes of Nazi Germany are a one-time thing.

He calls his political opponents "vermin," he talks about the blood of America being poisoned, and he says he wants to be a dictator on "day one."

Trump is trying to take America to a very dark place.

We don't want to trivialize this at all. But we are going to use this opportunity to ask you to make today the day you make your first donation to Joe Biden's reelection campaign.

Because if we don't have the resources to win, we won't. And this is the one thing you can do right now to make sure Trump doesn't get the chance to take this country backward. So please:
