The first congressmember to call for President Trump's impeachment says he is now drafting the articles for it.

Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) said Tuesday he is putting together the papers that would begin Trump's impeachment process for alleged obstruction of justice.

"This is not something that I wanted to do, it's something I feel compelled to do," Green said in a CSPAN interview.

"We will move forward, and as a matter of fact, I am currently crafting, drafting if you will, articles of impeachment," he added.

Green alleges that Trump's abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey this month — and the subsequent revelations that Trump allegedly grilled Comey about the federal probe into the Trump campaign's Russia ties — amounts to obstruction of justice.

It is unclear how far Green is on the articles and whether he plans to file a privileged resolution for impeachment, which the House would be required to consider within two days of delivery.

But Green said he was working with constitutional lawyers, and he's prepared to start the fight alone if no one in the House joins him.

"I am a voice in the wilderness," he said.

"I understand that I may stand alone, but I still stand, but our President obstructed justice."

Messages to Green's Washington D.C. office were not immediately returned.

Green last week became the first person in Congress to demand Trump's impeachment as Washington grappled with the fallout of Comey's unexpected ouster.

The Texas Democrat, who is black, has since been bombarded by anonymous callers who threatened to lynch him and used racial slurs against him.

Several Republican House members last week also suggested Trump might have committed obstruction of justice and, if so, would deserve an impeachment hearing.

The White House story about Comey's firing changed several times in the chaotic days afterward, but Trump and his team have denied any attempt to halt the FBI probe.
