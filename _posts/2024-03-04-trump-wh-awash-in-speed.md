- Under Trump, the White House Medical Unit was "like the Wild West," and staffers had easy access to powerful stimulants and sedatives, sources tell *Rolling Stone*

If you ever looked at the actions of the Trump White House and wondered, 'Are they on drugs?' --- the answer was, in some cases, yes. Absolutely, yes.

In January, the Defense Department's inspector general released a report detailing how the White House Medical Unit during the Trump administration distributed controlled substances with scant oversight and even sloppier record keeping. Investigators repeatedly noted that the unit had ordered thousands and thousands of doses of the stimulant modafinil, which has been used by military pilots for decades to stay alert during long missions.

The report didn't say why so many of those pills had been given out. But for many who served in the Trump White House, the investigation highlighted an open secret. According to interviews with four former senior administration officials and others with knowledge of the matter, the stimulant was routinely given to staffers who needed an energy boost after a late night, or just a pick-me-up to handle another day at a uniquely stressful job. As one of the former officials tells Rolling Stone, the White House at that time was "awash in speed."

Knowledgeable sources say that samples of the stimulant were passed around for those contributing lines to major Trump speeches, working late hours on foreign policy initiatives, responding to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, coping with the deluge of media inquiries about that investigation, and so much more. (Trump's campaign did not respond to an email seeking comment for this story.)

Modafinil --- also known by its brand name, Provigil --- wasn't the only controlled substance that Trump officials young and old routinely acquired. "It was kind of like the Wild West. Things were pretty loose. Whatever someone needs, we were going to fill this," one source with direct knowledge of the matter recalls.

The anti-anxiety medication Xanax was also a popular, easy-to-get drug during the Trump years, three sources tell us. Neither Xanax nor its generic, alprazolam, is mentioned in the Pentagon report, which notes that it is not a comprehensive list of the controlled substances ordered during the Trump years. Two people with direct knowledge of the situation recall senior officials getting Xanax from the White House Medical Unit --- and sharing it with colleagues.
