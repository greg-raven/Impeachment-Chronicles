- The House Intelligence Committee, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff, concluded in a 300-page report that President Trump tried to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.

> ”This is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy. This is about our national security. This is about whether the American people have a right to expect that the president of the United States is going to act in their interests, with their security in mind and not for some illicit personal or political reason. So Americans should care deeply about whether the president of the United States is betraying their trust in him, betraying that oath that he took to the Constitution to protect our country and defend its institutions. So, we should care about this. We must care about this. And if we don’t care about this, we can darn well be sure the president will be back at it doing this all over again. This is the result of a president who believes that he is beyond indictment, beyond impeachment, beyond any form of accountability and, indeed, above the law. And that is a very dangerous thing for this country.”
