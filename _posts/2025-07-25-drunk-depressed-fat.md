**Rosie O'Donnell blames Trump for her overeating and overdrinking**

Actress and comedian Rosie O'Donnell said President Donald Trump's first term took a severe toll on her mental and physical health, leading her to overeat, overdrink, and leave the United States for Ireland for "self-preservation" following his November election win.

In an appearance Tuesday on The Chris Cuomo Project podcast, O'Donnell revealed that Trump's presidency, particularly his second election victory, drove her to leave the country for her own well-being and for her autistic, nonbinary child.

"I was very, very depressed. I was overeating. I was overdrinking," O'Donnell told Cuomo. "It hurt my heart that America believed the lies about him. And then it broke my heart to be in a business that creates and sells those lies for profit."

While many celebrities threatened to leave the country over Trump, O'Donnell said she wasn't one of them, until she realized staying could endanger her mental health.

"I really felt this was self-preservation," she said.

**Rosie O'Donnell Reveals Why She's So Sad and Fat**

Rosie O'Donnell, the self-proclaimed "actor" and "activist," revealed Tuesday that President Donald Trump's first term drove her into depression, overeating and drinking too much.

She made this confession during a Tuesday interview on The Chris Cuomo Project podcast, while explaining why she fled to Ireland after Trump's 2024 landslide win.

"I wasn't one of those people who said, 'If he gets elected, I'm going to move.' I knew that I would never move because I'm very much a homebody and I like to be near my kids â€¦ but I really felt this was self-preservation for me," O'Donnell said.

"Because during his first go-round, it was very difficult and I got myself into some bad places, you know. I was very, very depressed. I was overeating. I was overdrinking. I was so depressed, Chris," she added.
