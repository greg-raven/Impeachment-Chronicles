Fox News anchor Chris Wallace repeatedly tried to get House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to concede that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has cleared Donald Trump of "criminal collusion," but Nadler refused to go along with him.

On this week's edition of Fox News Sunday, with the contents of the Mueller report still a mystery, Wallace asked Nadler to read the "tea leaves" of what little we do know.

"The Justice Department says that the special counselor is not recommending any new indictments, that means that no one will have been or will have been charged with collusion with the Russians," he said. "And President Trump clearly couldn't do that himself, so in effect, isn't it a logical assumption that the special counsel did not find any criminal collusion with the Kremlin?"

"Well, all we know is that the special counsel ,or we think we know, is that the special counsel is not bringing criminal indictments for collusion," said Nadler, adding that "There are other investigations going on which he's farmed out to the Southern District of New York, the Eastern District of Virginia, and they are may or may not."

"We do know, remember, in plain sight, of a lot of collusion," Nadler continued. "We know for example that the president's son and his campaign manager were present at a meeting with the Russians to receive information which they were told, in the invitation was part of the Russian government's attempt to help them in the election. We know that the campaign manager gave targeting data, political targeting data, to an agent over the Russian government."

"So, you know, we know a lot of things, and maybe it's not indictable but we know there was collusion. The question is to what degree and for what purpose," he said.

"Excuse me sir, that's the point I was going to make," Wallace interrupted. "Jared Kushner was not charged for that, Paul Manafort was not charged, Don Jr was not charged, so it would seem that there was no criminal collusion among them, so it would seem to clear the president on that issue."

"No, it would not," Nadler said. "The *Washington Post* has a story today which says that encounter intelligence investigations because of the way they are done and because of the way counterintelligence works, very often they do not lead to criminal prosecutions. But these are additional reasons we have to see the report, the entire country, the public, needs to see the entire report, so we can see what the special prosecutor says about these questions. Right now it's very speculative."
