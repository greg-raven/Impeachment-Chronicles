- Too many representatives chose to bloviate instead of interrogate --- except for one.

On Wednesday, Michael Cohen, President Trump's one-time personal lawyer and "fixer," testified in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee about what he says are a variety of shady practices he participated in when working for the president. People around the country awaited riveting testimony, some going so far as to join "watch parties" in bars.

But like so many congressional hearings, the fireworks were quick to flame out. Even with the tantalizing opportunity to grill Mr. Cohen on the myriad ways his former boss most likely sought to evade the law and avoid his creditors, many members of the committee, from both parties, could not resist their usual grandstanding.

Consider the line of questioning from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. She asked Mr. Cohen a series of specific questions about how Mr. Trump had handled insurance claims and whether he had provided accurate information to various companies. "To your knowledge," she asked, "did Donald Trump ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?" He had.

She asked whether Mr. Trump had tried to reduce his local taxes by undervaluing his assets. Mr. Cohen confirmed that the president had also done that. "You deflate the value of the asset and then you put in a request to the tax department for a deduction," Mr. Cohen said, explaining the practice. These were the sort of questions, and answers, the committee was supposed to elicit. Somehow, only the newer members got the memo.

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez continued, asking, "Do you think we need to review financial statements and tax returns in order to compare them?" She pressed Mr. Cohen for the names of others who would be able to corroborate the testimony or provide documents to support the charges. In response, Mr. Cohen listed the executives Allen Weisselberg, Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari --- names that, thanks in part to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, we will probably hear more about in the coming months.
