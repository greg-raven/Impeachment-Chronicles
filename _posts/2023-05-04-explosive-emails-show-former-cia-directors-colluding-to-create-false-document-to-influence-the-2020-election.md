A bombshell new email obtained by JustTheNews reveals damning new details about the lengths that former acting CIA Director Mike Morell went in order to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election. The email, sent by former CIA Director Mike Morrell to Obama-Era CIA Chief John Brennan, shows an effort to create pushback against Donald Trump before the 2020 election.

In 2020, 51 intelligence agents signed a letter stating that the Hunter Biden laptop story was disinformation and potentially part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Now, this newly released email shows more details about how the letter was orchestrated. Specifically, one of the intended purposes of the letter was to give Biden ‚Äútalking points‚Äù during the 2020 debates against President Donald Trump.

According to John Solomon, ‚Äúthis is the ultimate proof that what went out on that letter was a political dirty trick coordinated with the Biden campaign.‚Äù Solomon continued, ‚ÄúA man with a security clearance, a man with the title of CIA director, knew that he wasn‚Äôt creating an intelligence product, American civic duty with 51 people. He was trying to create a political moment.‚Äù
