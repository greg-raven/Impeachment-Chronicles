> “Barely two weeks after Donald Trump took office, Eric Ciaramella — the CIA analyst whose name was recently linked in a tweet by the president and mentioned by lawmakers as the anonymous “whistleblower” who touched off Trump’s impeachment — was overheard in the White House discussing with another staffer how to remove the newly elected president from office, according to former colleagues.”

See “[Whistleblower was overheard in 2017 discussing with ally how to remove Trump](http://greg-raven.github.io/Impeachment-Chronicles/2020/01/22/whistleblower-was-overheard-in-2017-discussing-with-ally-how-to-remove-trump/).”
