Earlier this year, *Rolling Stone* reported that Donald Trump had taken to asking close advisers for the names of Justice Department staffers and senior FBI agents who have worked on federal probes involving him, because, in the event he wins the 2024 election, he wants them "quickly" and "immediately" fired. That level of petty retribution is, of course, totally within character for the ex-president, who regularly fired people over Twitter when he was in office and then insulted their intelligence to boot. But apparently it's nothing compared to what former administration officials fear he'll do to his perceived enemies --- a group that includes Joe Biden --- in the event he wins a second term.
