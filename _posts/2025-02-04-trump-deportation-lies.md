Trump said he was going to deport millions and millions of immigrants.

As always, another lie and an example of gross incompetency.

To date Trump has not deported a single immigrant more than Biden has been doing all along. In fact, even the vast majority immigrants he has had arrested have been released back into the country for lack of facilities to house them.

In order to remedy this, the genius, Tom Homan, has promised to build housing for 30,000 immigrants in Guantanamo. The problem is there is only room for 30 prisoners right now. Do you really think he can increase in by one thousand with the limited budget he has now?

Also, the courts haven't yet decided whether, or not, Trump has the authority to carry out his threats. Will they risk building 30,000 units which will never be utilized?

Yet another example of the arrogant incompetence plaguing this administration.
