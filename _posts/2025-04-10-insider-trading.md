- U.S. president posted it was 'a great time to buy' on social media just hours before pausing tariff impositions

Donald Trump is facing accusations of market manipulation after posting on social media that it was a "great time to buy" just hours before he made a dramatic U-turn on his trade war that led to big rises in stock markets around the world.

Shortly after U.S. markets opened on Wednesday morning, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social: "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT".

Less than four hours later, he shocked investors by announcing a 90-day pause on additional trade tariffs on most countries except China, sending share indexes soaring.

In America the S&P 500 blue chip index closed up by more than 9%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq index shut more than 12% up. Stocks continued to rise in Asia and Europe on Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index up by 9%, and London's FTSE 100 index rising by as much as 4% in early trading.

Trump does not usually sign off his post with his initials. Those letters happen to be the same as the ticker for Trump Media & Technology Group, the business that controls Truth Social, whose stock shot up by 22% on Wednesday.

The timing of the U.S. president's posts and subsequent huge share jumps has sparked accusations of market manipulation. The Democratic senator Adam Schiff has called for an investigation, saying: "These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading.

"Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip-flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public's expense? I'm writing to the White House --- the public has a right to know."

The Democratic senator Chris Murphy also wrote on X that an "insider trading scandal is brewing ... Trump's 9:30am tweet makes it clear he was eager for his people to make money off the private info only he knew. So who knew ahead of time and how much money did they make?"

The New York Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for all members of Congress to disclose any stocks they had bought in the past 24 hours. "I've been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor," she wrote on via [ùïè](https://x.com). "Disclosure deadline is May 15th. We're about to learn a few things. It's time to ban insider trading in Congress."
