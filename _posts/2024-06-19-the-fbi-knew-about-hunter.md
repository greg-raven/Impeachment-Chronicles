Pretty big story just dropped

The FBI knew since 2016 Hunter Biden nearly scored $120 million Ukrainian deal while Joe was VP --- And While Trump was Being Impeached over Ukrainian Phone Call

"It's an extraordinary story because the FBI knew about it in 16, but when Donald Trump was being tried for Impeachment in 2019/2020, these documents were not made available to his defense ...

Imagine if the American people knew that story, that Hunter Biden was poised for a $120 Million pay day. The impeachment would have been stopped in its grounds."

- After 5 years, Just the News uncovered that the FBI learned as far back as 2016 that Hunter Biden and his partners had plotted to set up a new venture in tax-friendly Liechtenstein that would be capitalized by a whopping $120 million investment from the controversial owner of the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings,

The mega-deal was not referenced inside Hunter Biden's now infamous laptop or during the 2019 impeachment proceedings involving Ukraine, but was instead chronicled in a trove of 3.39 million documents the FBI seized from Hunter Biden and his business partners during an investigation of securities fraud nearly a decade ago.

- The cache of documents was recently turned over by former Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer to the House Oversight Committee as part of its impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden's conduct.

- The new evidence shows the major investment plan was being built at the time when Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board of directors and Joe Biden was still serving as Barack Obama's vice president in charge of U.S.-Ukraine policy.

The memos state Hunter Biden was also supposed to serve on the board of the new company called Burnham Energy Security LLC, and it was going to be capitalized in 2015 by Burisma owner Nykola Zlochevsky, who at a time was trying to get out from under corruption allegations in his home country.

- The Hunter Biden-connected Burnham entity was slated to get a quarter of the new venture's net revenues without putting up any cash, according to recent testimony to Congress from one of the partners.

- Zlochevsky, the Ukrainian oligarch, meanwhile was committed to "$120 Million over thirty-six (36) months to be invested in exploration and leasehold improvements" in the new venture designed to make Burisma a global energy leader, according to a prospectus for the project.
