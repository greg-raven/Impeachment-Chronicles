When I wake up in the morning and shut my eyes at night I'm thinking about ways to fight for the American people, to protect fundamental rights, and to defend our democracy.

That is the privilege and responsibility of a President, and I don't take it for granted for even a second. However, Donald Trump has a different vision of a President, one who only thinks about himself and how to enrich his friends.

Time and time again, my predecessor has made it clear: when he wakes up every morning, he's only worried about himself.

But Donald Trump is ratcheting up his attacks, lies, and spending to try to derail our momentum and secure a second term.

I won't let that happen ...
