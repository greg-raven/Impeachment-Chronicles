Former CIA Director John Brennan on Friday blasted President Trump for his defense of a business deal he pursued in Russia in the months leading up to the presidential election.
"The iceberg of lies, deceit, corruption, & criminality is steadily but surely surfacing, despite the efforts of many in high places to keep it submerged," Brennan wrote on Twitter.
"How large is the iceberg & who will be found clinging to it? The wheels of justice turn slowly, but grind exceedingly fine," he continued.

His remarks came in response to tweets sent by Trump on Friday morning, in which he defended his efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the presidential election as "very legal & very cool."
