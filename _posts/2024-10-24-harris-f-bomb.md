Kamala Harris came out strong on Wednesday night in her CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper and an audience of undecided voters in Pennsylvania's Delaware County. She began by citing the testimony of Donald Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, along with his national security advisers, his secretaries of defense, his chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his vice president --- all of whom have spoken of his unfitness to serve as president.

It was persuasive stuff, compellingly delivered --- an example of the power of the old journalistic rule about showing rather than telling. Then, in answer to a question from Cooper as to whether she considered Trump to be a "fascist," she replied, "Yes, yes I do."

Uh oh.
