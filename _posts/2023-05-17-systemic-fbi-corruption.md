- The [Durham Report]({% post_url 2023-05-12-durham-report %}) contains more evidence that high-level federal intelligence officials see it as routine to put powerful Democrats above the law.

Former FBI General Counsel Andrew Weissmann and others lied to the nation about the special counsel report released Monday that deeply documents years of systemic FBI corruption in favor of the Democratic Party. That report reveals and adds detail to multiple instances in which FBI employees used high-level intelligence and law-enforcement positions to promote misinformation that affected at least two presidential elections, always on behalf of Democrats.

Special Counsel John Durham's report lists and compares multiple such instances to illustrate "Systemic Problems" that are "difficult to explain." Many more have been uncovered in the past few years. This information key to Americans' oversight of their government through free and fair elections has been blacked out on corporate media airwaves and censored online by private grantees and social media companies obeying funding conditions and threats from federal officials.

## 1. Weaponizing Democrat Party Misinformation Developed With Probable Foreign Spies

It just so happens that the false information the FBI used to immediately open a spy operation on Democrats' opposition was developed by the Democrat presidential campaign, in conjunction with at least two potential or allegedly former foreign spies.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Danchenko is the guy who may be a Russian spy. Your tax dollars at work funding disinformation that helps the Democrat Party. <a href="https://t.co/dFMyHnnC2m">https://t.co/dFMyHnnC2m</a></p>&mdash; Joy Pullmann (@JoyPullmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyPullmann/status/1658218561972609034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote>

According to the [Durham Report]({% post_url 2023-05-12-durham-report %}), top FBI, DOJ, and CIA officials, as well as President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, were told "within days of its receipt" that the Hillary Clinton campaign had developed a "plan to vilify Trump by tying him to Vladimir Putin so as to divert attention from her own concerns relating to her use of a private email server."

CIA Director John Brennan briefed President Obama, Biden, FBI Director James Comey, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch on this intelligence on Aug. 3, 2016, a few days after Clinton's campaign developed the plan. The CIA reportedly got this info about Clinton's smear plan from its surveillance of Russian intelligence.

This means that, in the summer of 2016, the FBI and DOJ, and the head of the Democrat Party, knew that the [Steele Dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}), Alfa Bank allegations, and other claims of Donald Trump being a traitorous Russian stooge "were part of a political effort to smear a political opponent and to use the resources of the federal government's law enforcement and intelligence agencies in support of a political objective."

This should have gotten the FBI to question its [Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %}) operation, Durham's report says. Instead, however, the FBI raced ahead, with FBI headquarters demanding faster pursuit of Trump under what they knew were false pretenses.

The FBI's actions indicated a clear double standard for Republicans and Democrats, the report shows. "Unlike the FBI's opening of a full investigation of unknown members of the Trump campaign based on raw, uncorroborated information, in this separate matter involving a purported Clinton campaign plan, the FBI never opened any type of inquiry, issued any taskings, employed any analytical personnel, or produced any analytical products in connection with the information," notes the [Durham Report]({% post_url 2023-05-12-durham-report %}).

The report says if the Clinton campaign knowingly supplied this false information to the government, that's a criminal offense. Durham claims his team was unable to establish this criminal intent, but it's obvious it existed even if it can't be established with emails and voice recordings.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Durham report is damning. It shows the FBI operating as a disinformation shop for the Clinton campaign, ignoring its own rules, and blatantly &amp; maliciously interfering in a presidential election. The Steele dossier was fake, and FBI knew it all along. <a href="https://t.co/vGkPYloz5B">pic.twitter.com/vGkPYloz5B</a></p>&mdash; John Daniel Davidson (@johnddavidson) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnddavidson/status/1658198081668521985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote>

So, again, months before the press started stampeding false claims of Russian collusion into three impeachment attempts that strangled Trump's ability to wield the power voters had given him, the heads of U.S. intelligence agencies, the sitting president and head of the Democratic Party, and Democrats' next president were aware it was a political disinformation operation with no basis in fact. The head of that same FBI that ran a multi-year spy operation against Trump based on this claim knew it was politically motivated disinformation before the lie even got its boots on.

This goes far beyond agency "bias." It is the complete corruption of half of the nation's political party system and its federal law enforcement. It is the systematic disenfranchisement of Americans who don't agree with the national security blob — or wouldn't, if that blob allowed them to learn true facts about its evil machinations.

It is the systematic weaponization of the U.S. national security apparatus against constitutional self-government. It is the end of government of the people, by the people, and for the people in the United States of America. That's what Durham's report shows. Anyone who doesn't treat this as a five-alarm fire set by saboteurs is helping fan the flames.

## 2. Protecting Democrats' POTUS Pick While Slandering Republicans' POTUS Pick

Several times, the [Durham Report]({% post_url 2023-05-12-durham-report %}) notes that FBI and Department of Justice officials treated the Clinton and Trump campaigns completely differently. Another notable way was in regard to potential contacts with agents from foreign governments.

When the feds learned of a foreign influence operation seeking to target Hillary Clinton, they gave her campaign what is called a "defensive briefing." That means they warned the campaign about the potential for undue foreign influence.

When the feds learned that a foreign influence operation might be seeking to target Trump, they warned almost everyone except the Trump campaign. The FBI, DOJ, and CIA not only gave Trump's campaign no defensive briefings on such potential threats, the report says, these agencies used the threats as an excuse to surveil Trump's campaign and boost Clinton's disinformation operation linking Trump to Russia in the press.

"The speed with which surveillance of a U.S. person associated with Trump's campaign was authorized … are difficult to explain compared to the FBI's and the [Justice] Department's actions nearly two years earlier when confronted with corroborated allegations of attempted foreign influence involving Clinton, who at the time was still an undeclared candidate for the presidency," says the report on pages 73 and 74.

## 3. Dismissing Foreign Funds Transfers for Clinton, Not for Trump

In contrast to the bureau's full-scale rush to use its powers to smear Republicans with known falsehoods, the report shows that when the FBI knew the Democrat presidential campaign might be violating federal law, the FBI stood down. When an informant told the FBI the Clinton campaign was likely accepting illegal foreign campaign contributions, the FBI told the informant to drop it and did nothing further.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to an FBI CHS in early 2016, the Clinton Campaign was &quot;fully aware&quot; of and &quot;ok with&quot; a foreign contribution in violation of federal law. <br><br>The FBI agent didn't get receipts - and asked the source to stay away from the Clinton campaign.</p>&mdash; Techno Fog (@Techno_Fog) <a href="https://twitter.com/Techno_Fog/status/1658196047988924432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote>

"Once again, the investigative actions taken by FBI Headquarters in the [Clinton] Foundation matters contrast with those taken in [Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %})," says Durham's report. "As an initial matter, the NYFO [FBI New York Field Office] and WFO [Washington Field Office] investigations appear to have been opened as preliminary investigations due to the political sensitivity and their reliance on unvetted hearsay information (the Clinton Cash book) and CHS reporting. By contrast, the [Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %}) investigation was immediately opened as a full investigation despite the fact that it was similarly predicated on unvetted hearsay information."

Another double standard was revealed in this contrasting FBI treatment of different political parties: "Furthermore, while the Department appears to have had legitimate concerns about the Foundation investigation occurring so close to a presidential election, it does not appear that similar concerns were expressed by the [Justice] Department or FBI regarding the [Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %}) investigation."

## 4. Putting Powerful Democrats Above the Law

We already knew from the years The Federalist has spent unraveling Spygate that former FBI Counterintelligence Division Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok and his mistress, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's staff lawyer Lisa Page, weaponized their government positions to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. These are the two who infamously texted that they'd "stop" Trump from becoming president.

Durham's report shows multiple instances of McCabe, Strzok, Page, and their superiors wielding federal law enforcement positions as weapons against Republicans. The [Durham Report]({% post_url 2023-05-12-durham-report %}) contains more evidence that high-level federal intelligence officials see it as routine to put powerful Democrats above the law.

Besides the disparate treatment outlined above and many other such instances, Durham's report includes a telling text exchange between Strzok and Page. It shows them deciding not to apply the law to Hillary Clinton because of her powerful position. It seems that the powerful are indeed above the law in the United States — provided they're affiliated with the Democratic Party.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Report makes it clear that DOJ and FBI officials are afraid of Democrat retribution, but not of Republicans. See exchange between FBI's McCabe and Page: <a href="https://t.co/CUxd78rFRK">https://t.co/CUxd78rFRK</a> <a href="https://t.co/7kkSf4U5ai">pic.twitter.com/7kkSf4U5ai</a></p>&mdash; Joy Pullmann (@JoyPullmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyPullmann/status/1658204003451150340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote>

## 5. Refusing Interviews With the Special Counsel

Key FBI figures refused interviews with Durham's team, including Comey, Strzok, the Clinton campaign's Marc Elias, McCabe, Page, and Glenn Simpson of the opposition research firm that cooked up the [Steele Dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %}) for Clinton's campaign.

Add that to the many instances of "former" FBI and CIA figures being employed in social media companies to assist with government censorship demands, and going on TV to fuel the Russiagate hoax and other lies to Americans about crucial public issues. It adds up to yet another indication of an intelligence state using its vast — and unconstitutional — powers on behalf of the Democrat Party.

## 6. Refusing to Obey Congressional Subpoenas About Records on Biden Corruption

Durham's report indicates that the FBI repeatedly sat on evidence the Clinton campaign was accepting bribes — payments in exchange for policy preferences. The FBI is still doing that with Joe Biden. According to several high-level members of Congress, the FBI has been refusing to release to them subpoenaed, non-classified information about how it handled documentation alleging that Biden also traded political favors for campaign donations.

"We know the FBI relied on unverified claims to relentlessly target a Republican president. What did the FBI do to investigate claims involving a Democrat President?" asked Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

Numerous private and congressional watchdogs have documented that the Biden family has received millions of dollars from foreign individuals and companies connected to hostile governments including communist China.

"We believe the FBI possesses an unclassified internal document that includes very serious and detailed allegations implicating the current President of the United States," Grassley said in a press release earlier this month. "What we don't know is what, if anything, the FBI has done to verify these claims or investigate further."

Congressional subpoenas have the force of law. Federal agencies operate at the discretion and funding of Congress, according to the Constitution. The FBI's leadership doesn't seem to believe, however, that constitutional checks and balances apply to them. So long as Congress doesn't enforce its own prerogatives, the FBI's corrupt leaders are right.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Durham report concludes that FBI had evidence the Steele Dossier could have been sourced to Russian disinformation and didn't disclose this fact to keep getting warrants to spy on Trump. <a href="https://t.co/61pbBO0kNb">pic.twitter.com/61pbBO0kNb</a></p>&mdash; Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) <a href="https://twitter.com/Heminator/status/1658197577223766018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2023</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was so disgusted by the Jan. 6 riot that I deleted my Twitter account. I wrote introspective pieces on wanting to be part of the solution. (And I never liked Trump, and I thought Biden beat him.)<br><br>The Durham Report is 100x worse than Jan. 6.

It's been publicly known for decades that the FBI uses its surveillance, investigatory, and other law enforcement powers to manipulate American politics. Recall its surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr. and infamous FBI head J. Edgar Hoover's spying on the Supreme Court, Congress, and presidents.

The [Durham Report]({% post_url 2023-05-12-durham-report %}) is, in that respect, nothing new. What would be new would be punishing the FBI's use of blackmail, smear operations, threats, censorship, illegal spying, and election rigging. If that doesn't happen, the United States is quite simply not a free country anymore.
