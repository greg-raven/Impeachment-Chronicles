So ... um ... I was struck by something that was said tonight during public comment that we the ... um ... because of our woke agenda, or however it was described, um are like putting vulnerable students at risk and federal funding at risk, and I thought wow that is uh that's rich. So um who exactly is so threatened by the pillars and value of DEI or so threatened by pronouns that they would deny special needs students with the funding they need and deny children School meals? own it. uh own that shortsightedness and own that cruelty. Lastly to all those looking for ways to fight back I'll just ask you to keep standing with us, stand up for the marginalized children, and stand up for kindness and truth and Justice The goal with all of these executive orders is to destroy democracy. The speed and Reckless approach is a strategy meant to exhaust us and make us feel hopeless, so let's do the opposite of that let's show up here, show up in the streets, show up in the courts and if you're in a position that you can give some money, I suggest Lambda Legal who works to protect lgbtq plus students and people, Democracy Forward in the ACLU who are rapidly responding in the courts to these executive orders, and to the Human Rights Campaign there's many many more but those were the ones I chose to highlight tonight our kids and our schools are worth all we've got to give in this moment thank you.
