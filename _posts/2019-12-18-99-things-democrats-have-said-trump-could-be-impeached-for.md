President Trump was only in office two weeks before a Democratic congressman called for his impeachment.

On Feb. 1, 2017, mere days after the Trump’s inauguration, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said [the House should consider impeaching the president](https://news.grabien.com/story-rep-castro-floats-impeachment-trump-if-court-orders-exec-ord) in the event he doesn’t abide by court orders related to his travel ban.

President Trump did end up abiding by these court orders, but that didn’t stop Democrats’ calls for impeachment. Over the ensuing months, and years, Democrats have regularly come up with reasons why they should impeach the president.

At current count, Democrats have proffered 96 different reasons for impeaching Trump.

Below you’ll see a news list we’ve cross-posted from our sister site, NewsLists.co — [the original is here](https://lists.grabien.com/list-things-democrats-have-said-trump-could-be-impeached) — which is displayed chronologically.

By far the Democrats coming up with the most reasons for impeachment are Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas). At current count, Waters has produced 14 different reasons she thinks Trump’s impeachable; Green’s come up with 18.

A few of the more interesting: Rep. Green suggested impeaching Trump after his supporters chanted “send her back” in reference to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.); Rep. Waters has said he should be impeached simply for being “despicable.”

Those, of course, are just a sampling. See below for the comprehensive list. And if we’re missing any, you can add more by visiting NewsLists.co.
