Donald Trump was on Tuesday spotted without a mask entertaining guests at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida just days after the luxury golf resort was partially closed due to a coronavirus outbreak among staff.

The former president was photographed on Tuesday entertaining a number of guests at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach where he has lived since leaving the White House in January.

Trump, wearing a full suit and tie, could be seen in photos reported by the Daily Mail speaking on Tuesday outside to several guests on a balcony at the resort, where membership costs up to $200,000 a year.

The former president was also photographed on Sunday at Mar-A-Lago with GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, who posted videos and photos of himself with Trump on Sunday to Instagram. Neither Trump nor Cawthorn wore masks in the footage.

It comes just after the resort was forced to close some of its facilities due to an outbreak of coronavirus among "some staff.

*People* magazine reported that an email sent to Trump Organization employees said: "As some of our staff have recently tested positive for COVID-19, we will be temporarily suspending service at the Beach Club and Ã  la carte Dining Room."

A representative for the Trump Organization earlier this week confirmed to Insider that the closure had taken place.

The email seen by *People* said: "We have already undertaken all appropriate response measures in accordance with CDC guidance, including activating a thorough sanitization and cleaning of any affected areas and all club facilities, and we will continue our heightened environmental cleaning regimen."

"We reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of all those who visit the Club."

The Daily Beast reported that the outbreak came after several groups held parties at the resort where people did not wear masks or practice social distancing, including Trump himself. Footage from one of those events depicted him maskless and hugging people, the Daily Beast reported.

A 500-person fundraiser for the charity Place of Hope is currently scheduled to go ahead on Sunday, Insider's Sarah Al-Arshani reported.
