Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson: "Trump is intimidated by the intellectual prowess of blacks like me."

> Since you are begging, I do believe that Donald Trump is intimidated. I know you' begging. No interruption. So let me just answer that. I do appreciate you begging. So I would just say it like this, that the president has always been intimidated by the intellectual prowess of black men. And so, of course, he would speak in those petite and puerile terms.
