Democrats on the House intelligence committee are sharply disagreeing with Republicans on the panel who say they don't see any evidence of collusion or coordination between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.

The top Democrat on the panel said Tuesday there is "significant evidence" of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. California Rep. Adam Schiff said Democrats are writing their own report with conclusions from the intelligence panel's yearlong investigation into Russian meddling.

Republicans announced Monday that they'd completed the committee's report and they saw no evidence of collusion. Democrats saw that report for the first time Tuesday.

The House panel is one of several congressional committees looking into the meddling. Special counsel Robert Mueller is conducting a separate criminal probe.

Schiff detailed to the PBS NewsHour the leads Democrats were following.

"If we're going to provide a full accounting to the public, these questions need to be answered. We cannot rely solely on Bob Mueller. His job is different than ours. It's his job to decide which laws have been violated and who should be prosecuted. It's not his job to tell the country what happened," Schiff told the NewsHour's John Yang.
