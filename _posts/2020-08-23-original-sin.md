<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">> The original sin of America is slavery. The original sin of Trump’s Presidency is a stolen election. For the sake of equal justice, human dignity, and the preservation of Democracy we can not let him steal another. To overcome we must overwhelm. VOTE!
