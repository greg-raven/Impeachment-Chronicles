Lincoln Project co-founder and former GOP consultant Rick Wilson appears to have taken Trump Derangement Syndrome to a whole new level.

Wilson, who has unsuccessfully dedicated the last decade of his life to opposing the Trump movement and preventing his winning election, described President Trump as a "corrupt and sick."

He made the comments during a livestream in which he ranted about the FBI raid at the home of former Trump national security advisor John Bolton.

"The thought you should keep in your mind today as you watch the story unfold is this is the first not the last," Wilson of the raid.

"They will use this as something for the MAGA's to crow over because it distracts them thinking about the fact that Donald Trump is a corrupt and sick pedophile."

While Wilson did not expand on his claims that Trump is guilty of sexually abusing minors, he appeared to make it in reference to the alleged claims that he had close ties to the deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

What makes his claims all the more ironic is that his Lincoln Project co-founder, was accused by 21 different men of trying to groom them online, often enticing them with talk of benefits and career opportunities.

Among his solicitations included sending messages to a 14-year-old boy, asking questions about his body and sexual preferences.

Wilson, meanwhile, is notorious for his violent and inflammatory rhetoric.

At the height of the protests against Tesla and Elon Musk as he was working on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Wilson urged people to "kill" the company and thereby "save the country."

Back in 2015 at the beginning of Donald Trump's rise to the Republican nomination, Wilson urged voters "to put a bullet" in Trump's political career.

"[They're still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump]({% post_url 2015-10-28-put-a-bullet-in-trump %})," Wilson said at the time. "And that's a fact."
