In case you missed it in a previous post, those interview transcripts that Rep. Adam Schiff has been sitting on for nearly two years have finally been released to the public, and one standout from Thursday is former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitting that he hadn't seen any hard evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Anecdotal evidence, maybe, but nothing concrete.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: former DNI James Clapper says : &quot;I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting/ conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election.&quot; -- in transcript of interview with House Intel during its Russia probe.</p>&mdash; Brooke Singman (@BrookeSingman) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrookeSingman/status/1258516364005748737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The Daily Caller's Greg Price was good enough to pull up an old CNN story in which Clapper tells reporters at a National Press Club event that "I think when you compare the two, that Watergate pales really in my view compared to what we're confronting now."
