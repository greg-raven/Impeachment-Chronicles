Former Vice President Joe Biden quipped that a woman who claimed she had a “very severe case of what’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome” should become his running mate.

The exchange occurred at a campaign event in Nashua, N.H., Tuesday after the woman told Biden that Trump is an “illegitimate president” because he won the 2016 election by nearly 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan and argued he was aided by the Kremlin.

“He’s an illegitimate president in my mind,” she said. “That’s it. I think all the talk about impeachment and what the Democrats should do, that’s fine, it’s theoretical at this point. Let them investigate, let them subpoena, let them go to the Supreme Court, he’s illegitimate.”

The woman said that she was worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin would attempt to meddle in the 2020 election, resulting in another term with Trump in the White House. She characterized such a prospect as “terrifying.”

“Would you be my vice presidential candidate?” Biden joked before saying, “Folks, look, I absolutely agree.”

Biden vowed to not trash other Democratic candidates, saying that regardless of what candidate secures the Democratic nomination, he or she must be able to defeat Trump. He then took a swipe at Attorney General William Barr’s decision to have a federal prosecutor investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.

“You’re absolutely right, and now that they have an investigation of the investigators who are investigating whether or not Vladimir Putin and the Russians engaged in trying to affect our elections, give me a break. Gosh almighty,” he said.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation determined that no Americans illegally colluded with the Kremlin during the 2016 election. However, Mueller’s report did not make a determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr has since said there’s insufficient evidence of an obstruction crime, but Democrats in Congress want to investigate further.

Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Monday that Barr instructed a federal prosecutor to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe amid concerns from Republicans that the FBI inappropriately conducted surveillance on members of the Trump campaign.

Biden is one of more than 20 Democrats running to secure the Democratic nomination.
