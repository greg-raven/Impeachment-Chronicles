Keith Olbermann just can't help himself when it comes to being an idiot online.

Olbermann has been on an incredible run of stupid content in the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. He's pushed the complete nonsense theory that Trump was never shot multiple times.

I completely debunk the claim Trump was hit by glass in the Instagram post below. Now, Olbermann is setting his sights on the St. Louis Cardinals over yet another situation he's gotten completely wrong.

**Keith Olbermann calls the Cardinals Nazis over DJ celebration**

Olbermann took to X Monday night to call the Cardinals Nazis, demanded players be banned for life and called for the MLB to take the franchise and blow up the stadium over a weekend celebration he incorrectly thought was mimicking Trump's legendary fist bump.

Yes, Keith Olberamann asked the MLB to blow up Busch Stadium because he thought players were doing a Trump celebration after Alec Burleson smashed a home run.

"F*CK THE ST. LOUIS CARDINALS," Olbermann further wrote.

[...]

There's just one major problem with Olbermann's insane tweet. The celebration wasn't modeled after Trump getting up following a bullet striking him in the ear.

It's actually a nod to Burleson being a rapper/DJ while in college. They're pretending to be fist pumping while holding headphones to one of their ears, as a DJ would. And the Cardinals have been doing it since before Trump was shot.

Don't let the facts get in the way, Keith. Keep calling for explosions.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Matt Carpenter says celebration supposed to mimic a DJ with ear/headphones cupped, started early this month &amp; inspired by Burleson’s “college rapper” nickname —Biscuit. <br><br>“Definitely not a political statement. That is off base,” insists Carpenter. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stlcards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#stlcards</a></p>&mdash; Derrick Goold (@dgoold) <a href="https://twitter.com/dgoold/status/1815123157457756491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Furthermore, it shouldn't be an issue even if Cardinals players had been mimicking Trump's fist pump after being shot.

Many people in America like the Republican leader, and the fact he got up after taking a bullet is nothing short of incredible.

Even Mark Zuckerberg --- a man who once suspended Trump from Facebook --- admitted it was insanely "badass."

Unfortunately, Olbermann got the basic facts wrong, but even if it had been a pro-Trump celebration, it wouldn't make anyone a Nazi or a bad person. It would just mean the person loved the fist pump, just like millions of other Americans.

Olbermann should think about dialing down the temperature for the sole reason he might want to stop embarrassing himself. It's a pathetic look. Agree? Disagree? Let me know at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.
