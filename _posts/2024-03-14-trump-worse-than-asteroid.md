This sequel to "Deep Impact" does not sound so intriguing.

The intonations of how a Trump presidency will lead to the worst calamitous results continue on cable news. Yes, the people who say it is the Republican Party that traffics in fear are delivering the nightmare scenarios on an almost daily basis.

The latest is from the re-re-re-reconstituted CNN morning show (we do not even know the name by this point), where David Frum was a guest, and he comes up with a ... shall we say curious analogy.

He likens a Trump presidency to a looming asteroid striking Earth, and it is foolhardy to complain about the age of the captain on the rocket sent to destroy the supernal rock because it has already launched. We think? And Cassie Hunt actually calls this, "A very interesting analogy."
