The 2016 election’s silver medalist is at it again, and she’s reviving an old boogeyman.

Ignoring the absolute lack of evidence that Russia intervened in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump’s campaign and lack of evidence of collusion, Hillary Clinton wants the world to know that Russia is ready to strike again.

According to Fox News:

> Hillary Clinton said on MSNBC’s “Reidout” Monday night that President Trump had commuted ex-adviser Roger Stone’s sentence “to basically shut up Roger Stone so that Roger Stone would not spill any more beans about what actually happened and what Donald Trump actually knew.”

“This is a continuation of the cover-up,” Clinton declared. It was not immediately clear what Clinton was implying that Stone could have divulged to prosecutors; Special Counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors never alleged that Stone had engaged in a criminal conspiracy with any Russian actor.

Although Clinton didn’t provide evidence to support her theory, she went on to assure viewers on the primetime show that Russia had successfully swung votes to Trump in 2016 — and will try to do so again.

It’s also unclear how the Russians were responsible for Hillary failing to campaign in Wisconsin.

In October 2016, when a Hillary presidency was a mere inevitability in the eyes of the media, she called Trump a “sore loser” because of a comment she interpreted as his refusal to commit to accepting the results of the election (which it turns out he had no problem doing for obvious reasons).

Ironically, years later it’s she who can’t seem to accept the results of the election, and she hasn’t even been creative enough to invent a new boogeyman.
