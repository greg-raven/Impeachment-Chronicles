Donald Trump has angrily denied claims by the director of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York that he bullied his way into a now famous cameo.

The former president made a brief appearance in the 1992 film in a scene filmed at the Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time.

Director Chris Columbus said Mr Trump insisted on appearing in the film if they used the hotel as a location.

But Mr Trump said the filmmakers were "begging" him to appear.

"I was very busy, and didn't want to do it. They were very nice, but above all, persistent," he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday.

"I agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas time," he said. "People call me whenever it is aired."

"If they felt bullied, or didn't want me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years?" Mr Trump added. "Because I was, and still am, great for the movie, that's why!"
