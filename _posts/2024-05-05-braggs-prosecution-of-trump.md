A crucial due-process provision is meant to prevent exactly what the DA has done: force a defendant to go to trial without being put on notice of the charge.

I have argued that former president Donald Trump's prosecution in the so-called hush-money case brought by Manhattan's elected progressive Democratic district attorney Alvin Bragg is offensive in various ways.

Bragg, an election denier, is trying to convict Trump of a crime that is not charged in the indictment --- to wit, conspiracy to steal the 2016 election by suppressing negative information in violation of federal campaign law. This violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which requires a felony charge to be spelled out in an indictment whose criminal elements have been established by probable cause \[...\]
