The *Washington Post*'s Jennifer Rubin accused the media of largely ignoring what she called former President Donald Trump's "emotional, physical, mental deterioration."

On her Green Room podcast for Politicon, Rubin claimed the "deterioration" of Trump has been "evident" for quite some time and was most recently highlighted by his "talking about Arnold Palmer's junk," his campaign stop at a McDonald's, and debunked claims about the response to Hurricane Helene.

Rubin believes it's so bad that Trump can't "finish a sentence" and the media ignoring this means they are "helping" him to win the presidential election.

She said:

> "We do see some improvement in the way the media is covering him. At least there are now some front page stories and top of the news stories on cable news about his emotional, physical, mental deterioration, finally, finally. Now where were they for months and months? As listeners of this program know, we've been talking about it for over a year. It's evident that he's not all there. It's evident that he can't sustain a thought. It's evident he can't finish a sentence. It's evident that he lives ina. world of delusions, but the media couldn't bring themselves to really acknowledge that."

Rubin argued that for media outlets to acknowledge what she's describing, they would need to drop their "pretend neutrality," which isn't good for business. She went on to accuse the media of being "not willing to cover what is arguably the biggest story in American political history and that is someone who is mentally unwell could very well be elected president of the United States."

"They would actually have to acknowledge that one party is incessantly lying, is catering to our worst instincts, and the other is not and for them, that's just not what they think they're there for. They're not in the truth telling business," she said.

The media, she added, functions too similarly to social media.

"That's what's wrong with our media. That's what's wrong with our politics. They're no longer in the truth seeking business as ugly and as dismaying as that may be," Rubin said. "They're in the keep people engaged and anxious and following the politics game because that's how we get clicks and that's how we get paid. That is no different, by the way, than what social media does. They're playing the same game."
