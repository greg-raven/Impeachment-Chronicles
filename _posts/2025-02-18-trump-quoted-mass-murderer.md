You know with regard to this statement, which again we ... we shall not believe Reince Priebus what he says don't worry that someone who saves his country cannot violate a law. Okay, it's been attributed by some historians, who aren't certain, to Napoleon. But I'll tell you where it's definitely been used far more recently, and that's with a white supremacist far-right extremist named Anders Breivik in Norway who killed 77 people in Norway, the worst modern mass murder in Norwegian history, including a mass murder --- two separate incidents by him on the same day --- uh ... including a mass murder at a kids camp in in Norway. And he's the one who describes himself as a Neo-Nazi who's used that statement more recently in history. And now our president is quoting that white supremacist Neo-Nazi murderer. If you voted for that you you you really need to question whether you're American anymore. But that's who's using that kind of statement. And listen, does Trump sit and read Norwegian history? Hell no. Someone is handing him this story, this quote, and we need to figure out out who keeps spoon-feeding him the white supremacy white terrorist philosophy. If you voted for that you you you really need to question whether you're American anymore.
