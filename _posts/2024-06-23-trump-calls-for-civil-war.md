- "I'm concerned about the safety of so many people in this country, particularly people of color."

In a recent interview with MSNBC, California Representative Maxine Waters claimed that supporters of Donald Trump may engage in violence should the presumptive GOP nominee not win a second term in November. "I'm concerned about the safety of so many people in this country, particularly people of color," Waters claimed.

"Donald Trump has said that if he does not win, it's going to be fraud, and because it's going to be fraud there's going to be blood in the streets. He threatens about a civil war, and he threatens there is going to be violence." She did not provide evidence of these assertions.

Waters went on to condemn the former president for his rhetoric, saying that she thinks, "Donald Trump has to take responsibility for what he says about blood in the streets and violence if he's not elected to be President of the United States of America."

Water's claims on MSNBC follows a segment she did on the network earlier this month where she called Trump supporters "domestic terrorists" and speculated that they were "preparing a civil war." Following her comments, many on social media highlighted Waters' own history of making controversial statements that some argue promote or incite violence.

In 2021 during the trial of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, Waters urged protesters to "stay on the street" and "get more confrontational" if Chauvin was acquitted. Additionally, Waters encouraged her supporters in 2018 to aggressively confront members of Trump's administration in public.

"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they are not welcome," Waters said at the time.
