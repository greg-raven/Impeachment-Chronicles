Special Counsel Jack Smith has been forced to drop his criminal prosecutions of President Trump. In court filings, first with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and then with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Mr. Smith stated that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel has determined that the Constitution requires that his prosecutions be dismissed. Mr. Smith claimed that the "Government stands fully behind" his unauthorized exercise of prosecutorial power and that the dismissal was "without prejudice." Nevertheless, these cases are now over; the American people have repudiated Mr. Smith and defeated the Biden-Harris Administration's disgraceful weaponization of our justice system.

AFL has been out front in the fight to protect the rule of law from the left's weaponization of our justice system to get President Trump. We repeatedly spoke out against Mr. Smith's unauthorized abuse of power, vigorously opposing his outrageous efforts to gag the President. We stood strong against the efforts by Congress and  DOJ, respectively, to ignore long-established guardrails on their investigative authority, override the separation of powers, and eviscerate long-standing presidential immunity rules. We investigated the allegations of coordination between Mr. Smith and Vice President Harris, and highlighted the double standards and cynical hypocrisy of the meritless "classified records" case.

Mr. Smith and his team of attorneys each had a special duty commensurate with their unique power as prosecutors to use that power properly, without abuse. Yet, each served as a willing tool in the Biden-Harris government's unprecedented lawfare campaign against President Trump. The American people have a right to know the truth about Mr. Smith and to full transparency regarding his team's connections to and communications with Biden-Harris political officials. AFL will keep working tirelessly to expose the truth and protect our justice system.
