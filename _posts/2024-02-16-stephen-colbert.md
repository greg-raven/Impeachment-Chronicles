Stephen Colbert projecting his unhinged TDS on national television.

> I know how numb we've become, but it's not normal. No other candidate for the presidency has ever had to pause his campaign to defend himself in multiple courts. And I'd like to point out that in all seven of his cases, no one --- no one --- doubts that he did these things. We're just sitting around patiently waiting to find out if the wheels of justice will grind fast enough for there to be any consequences.

> And the media is covering it like it's any other political story, like it's all horse race. But in this horse race, one of the horses is old, while one of the horses is old, has hoof-in-mouth disease, and keeps quoting horse Hitler.
