Witnesses in the Fulton County, Georgia, election interference case being contemplated against former President Donald Trump have told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution that they have been called to testify before a grand jury in the matter next week.

Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and independent journalist George Chidi independently confirmed that they had been contacted to testify on Tuesday.

> Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was on the other side of Trump's much-scrutinized demand that he "find" exactly enough votes to defeat Biden, told WSB he hasn't heard from Willis' office recently.
>
> "They're doing what they're doing, whatever that is," Raffensperger said. "And I'm sure I'll read about it in the AJC just like everyone else will."
>
> Others have privately confirmed to the AJC that they were subpoenaed to testify, though it was not immediately clear how many would be asked to come in early next week.

Duncan said in an interview on Saturday:

> I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting the facts.
>
> I have no expectations as to the questions, and I'll certainly answer whatever questions are put in front of me.

Trump himself called the probe a waste of local resources and a politically motivated attack designed to help Joe Biden in the 2024 race.

The AJC speculated that might mean they could be handing down indictments as early as next week in the matter.

The Fulton County DA's office did not respond to inquiries.
