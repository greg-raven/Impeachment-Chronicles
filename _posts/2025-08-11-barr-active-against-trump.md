New whistleblower evidence exposes Bill Barr as an active player in the Fulton County RICO case against President Trump!

Documents, texts, and handwritten meeting notes show that from 2021 to 2023, Barr met repeatedly with Fulton County DA Fani Willis, special prosecutor Jack Smith, and political operative Armstrong Williams. These weren't casual chats --- they were strategy sessions to coordinate legal attacks on Trump in multiple jurisdictions.

On January 19, 2023, Williams texted confirming a Barr‚ÄìWillis meeting. By February 27, 2023, meeting notes reveal Barr urging Willis to hit Trump with Georgia's RICO statute, calling it the most effective way to entangle him in court. The whistleblower says Barr and Willis discussed the timing of charges and how to make them stick.

And that's just one part of it. The same whistleblower accuses Barr of running an illegal visa operation --- fast-tracking work visas for foreign nationals through political backchannels, bypassing oversight, and leveraging his connections to shield the scheme from scrutiny. This wasn't about helping people --- it was about profits and power.

If true, this means the former Attorney General of the United States --- the man once responsible for ensuring equal justice --- was actively weaponizing the law against a political opponent while breaking it for personal gain.

This is the swamp in its purest form: insiders colluding to destroy a former President while cashing in on the side. Every one of these people needs to be hauled before Congress, put under oath, and forced to answer for what they've done.

The American people deserve answers.
