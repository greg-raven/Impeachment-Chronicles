On Wednesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy officially removed Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) from the House Intelligence Committee, prompting reporters from pro-Democrat CNN and MSNBC to scratch their heads and question what on Earth could have motivated McCarthy to do such a thing. Yet their theatrical protestations cannot change the fact that Schiff is a well-documented purveyor of disinformation, particularly with regard to the Donald Trump/Russia conspiracy theory.

It's remarkable to see a group of people who call themselves "journalists" so aggressively defending a Congressman who strung them along for more than three years with false promises and empty assertions.

During the Trump years, Schiff was a favorite guest on both CNN and MSNBC due to his penchant for promising that he had found "damning" evidence that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russians during the 2016 election. For a look back at Schiff's many lies from that period, watch the video below:
