This is not a coincidence

Trump parrots Hitler

Trump
: "We will root out" my political opponents that "live like vermin" within our country

Hitler
: Jews are "vermin" and "pests" that must be "exterminated"

Trump
: Immigrants are "poisoning the blood of our country"

Hitler
: "Contamination of the blood" by "an inferior race" will lead to the fall of Germany

Trump
: My political opponents "within our country" are "far worse" than the dictators of Russia, North Korea

Hitler
: We must all "recognize the greater inner enemy" in Germany
