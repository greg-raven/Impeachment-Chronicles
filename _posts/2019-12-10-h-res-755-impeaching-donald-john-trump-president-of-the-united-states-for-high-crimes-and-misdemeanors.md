Introduced by Rep. Jerrold Nadler D-NY-10

This resolution impeaches President Donald J. Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors.

The resolution sets forth two articles of impeachment of the President: (1) abuse of power by soliciting the interference of Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and (2) obstruction of Congress by directing defiance of certain subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives.
