Given the penchant for creating chaos that is the hallmark of George Soros and his minions, it ought not surprise anyone that the Soros organization, known as the Open Society Foundation, has turned up in a new trove of documents indicating how the Russian collusion hoax against President Trump dogged his first term.

According to this declassified memo, found in a 'burn bag' at the FBI:

> The Durham annex DECLASSIFIED:
>
> Here is Hillary Clinton's plan at 'Olympic Level.'
>
> The email attached from Leonard Benardo, Senior Vice President Open Society Foundations—George Soros:

> The point is making the Russian play a U.S. domestic issue. Say something like a critical infrastructure threat for the election to feel menace since both POTUS and VPOTUS have acknowledged the fact IC would speed up searching for evidence that is regrettably still unavailable.

Soros operative Benardo proposed the Russia collusion hoax and Hillary Clinton approved it. Assuming the memo is true, from there on out, it set off a course of events that hobbled Trump's first term, ruined the lives of many people who were close to him, and demonstrated the level of corruption found in the FBI, of the kind that no one would have suspected, such as altering documents to win FISA approvals from judges.

Soros, of course, loathes Republicans, and has been close to the Clintons or years. But the bigger question is how much this Russia collusion hoax, smearing Russia, too, for things it didn't do, was connected to the war in Ukraine, which somehow Putin launched, in response to something he considered a provocation. Was Soros behind that, too? He has clashed with Putin for years?

If so, it signals an unspeakable trail of destruction, all for a lie, and all for the hatred of President Trump and the Americans who elected him.

It's time for an investigation as to how legal and deep and destructive this really was.
