MSNBC host Ari Melber loses it and threatens to sue Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski for defamation.

The threat came after Lewandowski called out Melber for calling Trump's post-assassination attempt ear bandage a "spectacle."

Lewandowski: So you didn't say this bandage was a proper spectacle from a candidate who's obsessed with spectacles.

Melber: I didn't say it. Mr. Lewandowski, I did not say that. That is a false quote.

Lewandowski: I have it right here. It's clear.

Melber: What you have is a false quote.

Lewandowski: You absolutely said it.

Melber: What you have is a false quote. I'm putting you on notice. If you continue to repeat falsely that I said that, you will be potentially in a defamation situation because I didn't say that.
