- Sniper killed: sources

Former President Donald Trump was wounded on a Pennsylvania campaign stage by a sniper's bullet Saturday night in an apparent assassination attempt that nearly claimed his life, law enforcement sources told *The Post.*

Trump, who was speaking at a packed outdoors rally in Butler, Pa. when bullets started flying, later posted on his Truth Social site saying he "felt the bullet ripping through \[his\] skin," and that it "pierced the upper part of my right ear."

"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," said the 78-year-old presumptive Republican presidential nominee. "Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening."

The gunman was later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, sources told *The Post.*

Shots broke out just after 6:10 p.m. as Trump showed off a chart of border crossing numbers. Footage shows him grabbing his ear as shots are fired --- with the crowd screaming behind him --- and then someone yelling "Get down, get down, get down, get down!" as Secret Service agents piled on top of him to shield him.

As blood gushed from his ear, Trump was then rushed off stage --- but not before boldly pumping his fist into the air and twice telling the crowd to "fight!" He was then whisked away in a car to a Pittsburgh-area hospital.

"He came within inches of having his face shot open," a senior law enforcement source told *The Post.*

Crooks was not immediately identified because he wasn't carrying identification on him, and was killed by a Secret Service assault team.

Authorities said one rally-goer was killed and two others wounded. Their identities have not been released.

Crooks was believed to have crawled on the roof of a manufacturing plant about 400 feet from the former president at the Butler Farm Show grounds --- outside the security perimeter, according to law enforcement sources.

The counter-sniper team, which sources told *The Post* killed the shooter, returned fire from the roof of another building close to where Trump was located --- behind the audience stands.

An AR-style semi-automatic assault rifle was recorded from the scene, law enforcement sources told the Associated Press. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer announced that his panel will open an investigation into the shooting.

"Political violence in all forms is unAmerican and unacceptable. There are many questions and Americans demand answers," he said.

One Trump supporter told the BBC that he spotted an apparent sniper armed with a rifle on the roof of a building outside the security perimeter of the rally.

The witness said he and friends, who were hosting a party outside the rally, tried to alert Secret Service, and then watched the man open fire five times.

Video that is reportedly from the scene shows the gunman dead on the roof of a warehouse, with Trump supporters gathered around.

Other video circulating on X, showed two Secret Service snipers stationed on a roof near Trump responding to the shots from the gunman --- quickly taking aim and opening fire.

Following the shooting, which happened just minutes into the rally, Trump --- with blood oozing down the side of his face and mouth --- was shown telling the Secret Service agents surrounding him to wait, and gave a defiant fist pump to the crowd.

One witness, who said he was an ER doctor, told CBS News that he rushed toward the podium following the shooting and found one Trump supporter with a bullet wound to the head.

"There was lots of blood, and he had brain matter there," the man said.

Video shows one man being carried off the risers behind Trump, and a helicopter apparently evacuated the victim.

The terrifying attack marked the first attempt to assassinate a president or a presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.

About two and a half hours after the shooting, President Biden addressed the nation and called the attack on his Republican opponent "sick" --- though said "I don't know enough" to say it was an assassination attempt.

"Look, there's no place in America for this kind of violence. It's sick. It's sick. It's one of the reasons why we have to unite this country," Biden said.

"We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this."

However, five days earlier, Biden was heard in a campaign meeting saying, "[it's time to put Trump in a bullseye]({% post_url 2024-06-28-threat-to-our-nation %})
" with regards to the campaign, according to audio obtained by Politico.

Biden returned to the White House Saturday night, cutting short a weekend stay at his beach home in Delaware. The White House later confirmed that Biden and Trump spoke.

Trump's children shared heartfelt messages following the attack.

"Thank you for your love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today's senseless violence in Butler, Pennsylvania," Ivanka, a former White House top adviser wrote on social media.

"I am grateful to the Secret Service and all the other law enforcement officers for their quick and decisive actions today. I continue to pray for our country.

"I love you Dad, today and always," the 42-year-old wrote.

Eric Trump called his father the "toughest man I have ever met," while Donald Trump Jr. said his father will "never stop fighting to Save America."

Thousands had attended the campaign rally in Butler, where Trump was rumored to make an announcement about his vice presidential pick ahead of the Republican National Convention, which kicks off Monday in Milwaukee.
