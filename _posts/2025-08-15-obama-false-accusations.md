The legal accountability for former President Barack Obama in connection with the Trump-Russia collusion allegations is making headlines this week.

The controversy centers on allegations that intelligence agencies were used during and after the 2016 election to advance a false narrative tying then-President-elect Donald Trump to Russia.

Mike Davis, president of the Article III Project and a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, addressed the matter in July, noting that while Obama may be able to claim presidential immunity for actions taken while in office, that protection does not necessarily extend to actions taken after leaving the presidency.

"He [Obama] might be able to claim presidential immunity for his actions while he was the President of the United States, and they'll have to litigate that," Davis said.

> "It's unclear whether he'll ultimately get presidential immunity for this. But I'll tell you this: it's an ongoing criminal conspiracy. And presidential immunity covers his actions while he's the President of the United States.
>
> They don't cover his actions when he's the former President of the United States. And when he's participating in the cover-up of this conspiracy, then he doesn't have presidential immunity."
