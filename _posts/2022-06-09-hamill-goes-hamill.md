Star Wars franchise star Mark Hamill has once again espoused his belief that former U.S. President Donald Trump incited both a "violent [insurrection](/insurrection.html)" and a "coup" on the day at the center of the upcoming January 6th Committee hearings.

[...]

Ahead of this first hearing, Hammill took to Twitter in the early morning hours of June 9th to both share his anticipation at the day's upcoming proceedings and, as he has done many times before, accuse Trump of having engaged in treasonous behavior.

"I am SO ready for accountability for the violent insurrection against our government & the coup incited by Drumpf & his minions," accused Hamill. "Will YOU be watching the @January6thCmte?"

Alongside his tweet, Hamill shared a selfie wherein he emphasized his excitement by and holding a bowl of popcorn and both wearing a pair of socks featuring Edgar Allen Poe's face as well as a t-shirt that reads "Suspect Everyone."

As noted above, this is not the first time Hamill has accused Trump of inciting the events of January 6th.

In December 2020, the actor shared an article from Buzzfeed headlined "Here Are The Names Of 126 Members Of The House Who Refuse To Accept That Biden Won," and wrote, "Merriam-Webster definition of 'sedition': incitement of resistance to or insurrection against lawful authority #RememberTheirNames."

The next month, in response to Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen's call to "remove Trump" from Facebook and YouTube, Hamill opined, "His 30,000+ lies won't end when he leaves."

"His #BigLie that the election was stolen caused the violent insurrection in the Capitol & his followers to reject @PresElectBiden," he said. "Time for @YouTube & @Facebookto remove his poisonous lies PERMANENTLY... NOW. #Ban\_tRUMP\_SaveDemocracy".

In February 2021, Hamill encouraged his readers to read a piece from the New York Times which purported to track "Trump's Campaign to Subvert the Election", asserting, "A MUST READ: Anatomy of a violent insurrection."

"It all started with #TheBigLie that the election was stolen & he owns it," he declared. "ALL of it."
