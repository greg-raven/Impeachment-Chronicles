- New York AG had sought $250 million in civil case now on trial Filing previews closing arguments; Trump called case partisan

Donald Trump and his company should be ordered to pay $370 million, up from $250 million, for inflating the value of his assets in financial records for more than a decade, New York state told a judge who will eventually issue a verdict in the civil fraud trial.

The $120 million increase was included in a post-trial brief Friday by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Trump and The Trump Organization over the alleged fraud in 2022. The filing is a preview of the stateâ€™s closing arguments, which will be presented Jan. 11, with Trump likely in attendance.
