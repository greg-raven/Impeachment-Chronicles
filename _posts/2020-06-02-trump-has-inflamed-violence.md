Mariann Budde:
: We we are upset about the fire as well, but that is not our primary focus. Our primary focus is the reason behind, the fundamental reasons behind ... uh ... the protests in our country right now. 

Judy Woodruff
: I see today that the president's counselor Kellyanne Conway is saying ... uh ... for ... for people to question what the president did to call it a photo op or a photo opportunity is to question his faith. Is that what you're doing, are you questioning the president's faith? 

Mariann Budde
: No, I'm challenging his actions and I ... I'm ... I am ... I am saying to him and to all who will listen that ... uh ... the Gospel of Jesus and the teachings of the scripture are antithetical to the messages that he is communicating and the way he is is responding to people in this in this moment, and that there is no spiritual mantle of authority for the actions that he had just moments before said that he would take.

Judy Woodruff
: You ... you told the *Washington Post* yesterday --- and I'm quoting --- "everything this president has said and done is to inflame violence we need moral leadership and he's done everything to divide us." Is there any way to to begin to heal this breach that that you're describing?

Mariann Budde
: Well, you know we see examples of people attempting that across the country um the police officials and officers who are moving into the crowds to speak to them, the people who are acknowledging pain and seeking to make um fundamental change for the good of the nation and in particular for the ... um ... for the safety and dignity of black and brown people in this country. So yes there are any number of steps that any one of us can make including the president to heal the breach ... uh ... but it isn't um it isn't by inflaming emotions, it's trying to bring them down and trying to offer a word of unity rather than ... um ... rather than division.
