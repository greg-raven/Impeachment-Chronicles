We introduced readers to the #RevengeHoax last week, which involves media pundits warning that Donald Trump will imprison them if he wins the election. [Rachel Maddow]({% post_url 2024-06-11-maddow-terrified %}) was the first subject to stoke the flame.

"I'm worried about the country broadly if we put someone in power who is openly avowing that he plans to build camps to hold millions of people, and to 'root out' what he's described in subhuman terms as his 'enemy from within.'" Maddow told CNN.

"For that matter, what convinces you that these massive camps he's planning are only for migrants?" Maddow continued. "I'm worried about me --- but only as much as I'm worried about all of us."

Maddow appeared on "The View" Tuesday, when host Joy Behar discussed the alarm Maddow sounded. Of course, Behar did not challenge Maddow. Rather, she agreed out loud and put forth a conspiracy of her own.

"So you said recently that you thought that you, as an outspoken critic, could be a target yourself. Some people think that sounds overdramatic, but I'm right there with you," Behar informed Maddow.

"I think that he is so vindictive that he will go after [us], however he has to, through the IRS maybe, or even through sponsors, to get us off the air maybe, or you."

Maddow and the other women on set nodded in agreement:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Joy Behar fears Donald Trump could pull The View and Rachel Maddow&#39;s show off the air in a second term. <br><br>&quot;How seriously should we be taking that?&quot; <a href="https://t.co/eyukfAQirh">https://t.co/eyukfAQirh</a> <a href="https://t.co/F9qVj9TI9M">pic.twitter.com/F9qVj9TI9M</a></p>&mdash; Zachary Leeman (@WritingLeeman) <a href="https://twitter.com/WritingLeeman/status/1803096980240875963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You might wonder how exactly a President of the United States could take a show off-air by pressuring sponsors. We also wondered about that.

Unfortunately, Behar did not elaborate.

Presidents don't have the power to take shows off-air, otherwise, Obama would have tried it. And Trump isn't Media Matters, the obsessive left-wing watchdog that hounds sponsors of conservative media brands.

We could go on some long spiel about how these faux warnings show desperation creeping in, as hosts and politicians come to the realization that Trump is the favorite to win the election.

Then again, it's also fully plausible that years of unhealthy hatred toward Donald Trump has these kooks simply spiraling out of control.

To recap:

Rachel Maddow says Trump might put her in a camp with illegal aliens. Brian Stelter says Trump could "punish" him. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. says Trump may place her in prison. And Joy Behar says Trump could cancel "The View."

Enough already. Donald Trump is already polling ahead of Joe Biden. No need to entice voters more.
