"Trump gassed protesters for a photo op"

"Trump is ignoring Russian bounties on our troops"

"Trump called soldiers 'suckers'"

"The lab leak theory is a conspiracy"

"There won't be a vaccine by the end of this year"

"It's not safe to open schools"

All lies

"The Hunter Biden NY Post story is Russian disinformation"

"Donald Trump told politicians in Georgia to 'find the fraud'"

"DeSantis is evil and Cuomo is doing a great job"

"Locking down only for 15 days to slow the spread"

It goes on and on and on and on

^Those were all just from 2020:

"Russia hacked the election"

"Michael Cohen went to Prague"

"Fine people on both sides"

"Trump Jr. got the Wikileaks dump in advance"

"Pee tape"

And of course: "RUSSIAN COLLUSION"
