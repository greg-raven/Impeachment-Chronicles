RE: 'Arctic Frost' --- it has now been officially referred to @FBIDirectorKash and @AGPamBondi for criminal investigation and prosecution.

Senator Chuck Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson via WHISTLEBLOWER: CONFIRM a criminal conspiracy between the Biden White House, the FBI's Washington Field Office, prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., and Special Prostitute Jack Smith --- to plan, approve, and execute Arctic Frost with the intent to frame, arrest, prosecute, and imprison Donald J. Trump, effectively attempting to overthrow the constitutional republic of the United States.

Operation 'Arctic Frost' formed the basis of Special Prosecutor Jack Smith's false elector case, under which President Donald Trump was later charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States for his campaign's efforts to assemble alternate slates of electors --- which that the United States government was overthrown during the 2020 election.

Senator Chuck Grassland and Senator Ron Johnson:

> We have obtained additional Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) communications through legally protected whistleblower disclosures that show a conspiracy among anti-Trump FBI agents and prosecutors in setting up and advancing the Arctic Frost investigation.
>
> As we have explained in our previous correspondence, Arctic Frost was the codename for the investigation which ultimately became Jack Smith's elector case against President Donald Trump.
