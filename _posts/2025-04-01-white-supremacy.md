The word "whitewash" comes to mind. Here's one of Merriam-Webster's definitions of the word: to alter (something) in a way that favors, features, or caters to white people: such as to portray (the past) in a way that increases the prominence, relevance, or impact of white people and minimizes or misrepresents that of nonwhite people.

That's exactly what the Trump administration and its anti-DEI crusade are doing right now. This has nothing to do with discrimination; it has to do with the belief in white, Christian, male supremacy --- period.
