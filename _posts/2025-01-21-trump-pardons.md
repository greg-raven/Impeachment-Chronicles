Let's be clear: President Trump didn't just pardon protestors.

He pardoned people convicted of assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.

It is a betrayal of the highest order of our Capitol Police officers who risked their lives to keep us safe.

There's no other way to describe President Trump‚Äôs pardon of January 6th defenders than un-American.

It just is so cruel to the Sicknick family, who lost a police officer.
