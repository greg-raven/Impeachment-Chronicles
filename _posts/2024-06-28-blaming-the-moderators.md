Hollywood celebrities are lashing out & are blaming far-left moderators Jake Tapper & Dana Bash for Joe's dismal performance:

Stephen King: "The networks are packaging this as entertainment, like a boxing match, and selling democracy down the river."

Barbra Streisand: "What is wrong with these two moderators...? They ask him a question, but then let him go on a rampage about something else. Not fair!"

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What is wrong with these two moderators who let Trump change the subject? They ask him a question, but then let him go on a rampage about something else. Not fair!</p>&mdash; Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) <a href="https://twitter.com/BarbraStreisand/status/1806512635200102768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

John Cusack: "CNN letting this deranged liar lie with no consequences --- meanwhile --- dems thinks having the right data points matter --- This is the end my beautiful friends."

"Meltdown --- CNN set perfect conditions."

Jesse Williams: "Why moderate if you're not gonna moderate? Not a single lie checked."

Mark Hamill: "One off night also doesn't change the fact that the former guy is a convicted felon, serial liar & adjudicated r*p*st who is unfit for ANY office. Period."
