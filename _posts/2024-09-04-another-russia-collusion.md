2017
: I want to know what the Russians have on Donald Trump. I think we have to have an investigation by the FBI into his financial, personal, and political connections to Russia.

2018
: What do the Russians have on Donald Trump, politically, financially, and personally?

2020
: What does Vladimir Putin have on President Trump ‚Äî personally, politically, financially, in any way?

2024
: What does he have on Donald Trump? [...] I think it is probably financial, and it's probably financial, either something financial he has on, or something on the come.
