The Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General (IG) released a report last week revealing Democrat Members of Congress and their staff actively leaked classified materials to the media to push the Russia hoax narrative against President Donald J. Trump during his first term in office. According to the report, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was aware of the classified leaks and their sources but failed to pursue the matter adequately.

Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Eric Swalwell (D-CA) were named in the report as having purposely leaked classified documents to several corporate media outlets. The report states that a whistleblower who served as a Democratic staffer on a congressional committee identified the two California Democrats to the FBI. The whistleblower stated they “suspected that Member 1 had previously leaked classified information and that Member 2 wanted to influence public opinion via the release of classified information.”

Additionally, the IG report states a senior Democrat congressional staffer was found to be communicating with at least three members of the media who subsequently published classified information that he had access to. However, despite evidence of the leak being handed over to the FBI, the agency declined to investigate further. The New York Times identified the suspected leaker as Michael Bahar.The investigation included reviewing the communications of several congressional staffers. The DOJ appeared to monitor both Republican and Democrat staff members, as well as nonpartisan positions. A total of 21 Democrats and 20 Republicans had their communications analyzed. The report states that no charges were filed despite various individuals being implicated in leaks.
