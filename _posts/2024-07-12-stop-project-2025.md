This race is about you and your family. It's about your freedom. And it's about our democracy.

We stand for the proposition that all people are created equal --- and I'll be damned if I let Donald Trump walk this nation away from it.

\[...\]

Unlike Donald Trump, I don't work for Big Oil, for Big Pharma, for the NRA. I work for you, the American people. My first hundred days in a second term will continue to be all about the working people of this nation:

- We're going to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.
- We're going to defend the right to vote.
- We're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security.
- We're going to make the tax code fair.
- We're going to raise the federal minimum wage.
- We're going to continue lowering the cost of prescription drugs and expanding health care.
- We're going to keep leading the world on climate and clean energy.
- We're going to make housing more affordable.
- We're going to get weapons of war off our streets and ban assault weapons.

And above all else, we're going to uphold our Constitution and save our democracy.
