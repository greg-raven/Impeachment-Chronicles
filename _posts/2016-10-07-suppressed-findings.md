<abbr title="Office of the Director of National Intelligence">ODNI</abbr> and <abbr title="Department of Homeland Security">DHS</abbr> suppress the above September intelligence findings in their press release that states with "confidence" the Russian government directed the <abbr title="Democrat National Committee">DNC</abbr> and <abbr title="Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee">DCCC</abbr> hacks."

- Their statement omitted the fact that the <abbr title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</abbr> and <abbr title="National Security Agency">NSA</abbr> had "low confidence" in attributing the data leaks from these entities to Russia.

- Note: There is still supporting evidence indicating the Russian government directed hacking of the DNC and DCCC.
