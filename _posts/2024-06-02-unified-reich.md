Last week, Donald Trump posted a video to his social media suggesting a second term for him would create a "unified Reich" in America.

Folks, listen ... this is serious stuff. And it's not like Trump's echoes of Nazi Germany are a one-time thing.

He calls his political opponents "vermin," he talks about the blood of America being poisoned, and he says he wants to be a dictator on "day one."

Trump is trying to take America to a very dark place.
