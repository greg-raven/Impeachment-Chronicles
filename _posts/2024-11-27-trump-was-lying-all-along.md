Trump swore he knew nothing about Project 2025 or the people behind the scheme. Even after it was pointed out he flew to a Heritage Society conference with the author of the 'Project', gave a speech before them, and later said these were the people who are laying the agenda for is next administration, as he always does. he continued the lie.

As always, he lied and as always, the MAGA faithful believed.

Now spitting in the eye of the electorate, he is doing exactly what he promised them he would not do., Russ Vought, Trump's incoming Office of Management and Budget director, has played a major role in Project 2025. He helped draft executive orders that would undermine civil service protections and make it easier for Trump to fire thousands of federal employees, according to sources with knowledge of the project's internal workings.

Other incoming administration officials who worked on the project include Tom Homan, Trump's incoming border czar; Brendan Carr, Trump's choice for chair of the Federal Communications Commission; and John Ratcliffe, Trump's CIA director-designate.

Now, we hear a lot about Project 2025, but what exactly does it say? Is it as threatening to our way of life, our very democracy -- will it destroy the very basis of our government and lead to a new oligarchy with the destruction of our Constitution? Will it portend the end of religious freedom and install an insidious Christo=Fascist state?

Below is a link to the treacherous document. It will ask 'what you care about' and when you click on that a drop-down menu will offer you a range of topics covered in the 'Project'. When a choice is clicked on it will prov ide a brief synopsis of each of your concerns, as well as page numbers in red that will lead you to the specific text, should you want to question anything.

All Americans of all persuasions should be familiar with this agenda so they will recognize future lies.
