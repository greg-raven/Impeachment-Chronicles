After Will Smith smacked comedian Chris Rock at the Academy Awards last night, it quickly became clear that Donald Trump continues to live rent-free in so very many heads.

- Howard Stern has concluded that Trump and Will Smith [are the same guy]({% post_url 2022-03-28-smith-equals-trump %}).

- Steve Schmidt said the Oscars' audience's reaction to Smith slapping Rock can help us "[understand how Trump happened]({% post_url 2022-03-28-how-trump-happened %})."

- CNN analyst Asha Rangappa also [connected the Oscars incident to Trump]({% post_url 2022-03-28-normalizing-trump %}).

Who's next? Well, here's Rosie O'Donnell agreeing with Maria Shriver and explaining how watching events unfold was "like the Trump years":

Apparently there is no cure for TDS and it wonâ€™t go away on its own.
