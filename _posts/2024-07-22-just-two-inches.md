Amy Hutter is an administrative assistant at Des Moines Area Community College. She allegedly posted this message hoping for Trump to have a heart attack and seemed sad the shooter missed.

We reached out to @DMACC_Bears for comment and they said she doesn't speak for the college and "DMACC certainly does not condone hate speech or violence of any kind."
