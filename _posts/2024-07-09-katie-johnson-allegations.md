**Here's Everything We Know So Far About the 'Katie Johnson' Allegations Against Trump -- It's Serious and MUST Be Dealt With**

- This gets tricky, but it doesn't sound out of character for Trump OR Epstein.

My editor says I should put this disclaimer at the end, but I'm going to come right out front with it, just so you know this isn't clickbait. I have been reporting on Trump since before he was ever president, and nothing that is "alleged" here doesn't line up with other circumstances he himself has described as having done.

None of this has yet been proven in court.

But the severity of the allegations notwithstanding, Trump is a proud misogynist, and the myriad pictures of him leering at his own teenage daughter as she sat on his lap, later to say that if he weren't her father, he might be dating her, make everything in this viral story seem like it holds water.

Basically, what we have now is the story of an anonymous accuser who has gone variously by Jane Doe and now Katie Johnson. A post featuring a case filed against Trump in 2016 by an anonymous woman and Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile who died under mysterious circumstances in prison before he could be forced to testify about who had accompanied him on a plethora of "sex trips" to a private island of his, has been making the rounds since the release of a slew of documents related to the Epstein case were released recently.

The case alleged that she had been held by the men as a "sex slave" in 1994, when she was 13.

It says that she was forced to "perform lesbian sex acts" against her will.

It basically says everything that always came to your mind whenever you thought about Jeffrey Epstein, or Ivanka on Trump's lap.

This is how people got the details, not only about Trump&#39;s rape of Johnson, but about the relationship between &#39;pedo bros&#39; Trump and Jeffrey Epstein -- and their secret lives as sexual predators and child rapists. <a href="https://t.co/O7iEv2osTw">pic.twitter.com/O7iEv2osTw</a></p>&mdash; Bill Madden (@maddenifico) <a href="https://twitter.com/maddenifico/status/1810699562115309790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The April 2016 filing --- coincidentally right around the time that Trump was being accused of his affairs with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, during the election --- was dismissed by a judge on lack of merit. The case was refiled in June, then again in September of that same year.

At the time of the filing, Trump's then-lawyer, Alan Garten, told Politico that the charges were "categorically untrue," though the disappearance of Ms. Doe/Johnson certainly raises some doubts. She hasn't been heard from since she dropped the last case she filed due to death threats.

"It is completely frivolous. It is baseless. It is irresponsible. I won't even discuss the merits because it gives it credibility that it doesn't deserve," said Garten. That ALSO sounds a lot like what his lawyers were saying about Stormy and Karen --- that they wouldn't even dignify it with a response. Trump's sentencing in the hush money case involving those two is scheduled for September.

Although Epstein died awaiting trial for his 2019 case of sex trafficking, his grooming partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted and is serving a 20-year sentence.

Among the things released with the Epstein documents recently were a trove of pictures of Trump and Epstein together, both on his plane and on the island, and even at Mar-a-Lago.
