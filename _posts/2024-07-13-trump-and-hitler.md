Hillary Clinton comparing Trump to Hitler on The View is just one reason this happened to President Trump today.

Sunny Hostin
: What, in your view, would happen if he were to be re-elected?

Hillary Clinton
: Oh, I can't even I can't even think that because I think it would be the end of our country as we know it.

Hillary Clinton
: You know, when I'm secretary of state, I used to talk about one and done.
: And what I met by that is that people would get legitimately elected and then they would try to do away with elections and do away with opposition and do away with a free press.
: And you could see it in countries where, well, Hitler was duly elected, right?
: And so all of a sudden somebody with those tendencies, though dictatorial authoritarian tendencies would be like, oh, okay, we're going to shut this down.
: We're going to throw these people in jail and and they didn't usually telegraph that.
: Trump is telling us what he intends to do to listen to take him at his word.
: The man means to throw people in jail who disagree with him, shut down legitimate press outlets, do what he can to literally undermine the rule of law and our country's values.
