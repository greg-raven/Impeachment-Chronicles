- “The officials … signed a letter saying that the laptop ‘has the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation’.”

Earlier this week, the New York Times infamously “broke” the story about Biden family influence peddling first reported by the New York Post on October 14, 2020 and followed up with more explosive information about the deals that were struck with foreign entities and the “cut” that would go to “the big guy,” Joe Biden.

The journalist who broke the story, Emma-Jo Morris, is now at Breitbart and has some thoughts about their “scoop.”

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">> NYT casually admitted this week that my reporting on the Laptop From Hell was authentic, as if we all forgot they called it “baroque mythology” at the time.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div></figure>Well over a year after the 2020 presidential election and while everyone is focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Times thought it would be good to get it into the “paper of record” that yes, Hunter Biden’s laptop did contain verified and very troubling information, including the peddling of his father’s influence when the latter was serving as vice president under Obama.

We covered the influence peddling revelations and the collusion across government, media, and Big Tech to quash the truth. Here are just a few of our posts (there are many more):

- Emails: Top Ukranian Exec Asked Hunter How to ‘Use Your Influence’ on Burisma’s Behalf.
- Hunter Biden Pursued ‘Lasting and Lucrative’ Deals With Chinese Private Energy
- Hunter Biden Text Messages: Chinese ‘Coming to be MY Partner, to be Partners With the Bidens’
- DNI Ratcliffe: Hunter Biden’s Laptop ‘Not Part of Some Russian Disinformation Campaign’
- Influence Peddling Scandal: The Silence Of The Bidens Is Deafening
- NBC News debunks old Hunter Biden non-story to distract from real story of influence peddling
- Twitter Changes ‘Hacked Materials Policy’ After Backlash From Blocking New York Post’s Hunter Biden Stories
- Facebook, Twitter ‘Reducing’ the Distribution of New York Post Story on Hunter Biden Emails

At the time the Post broke the story, the entire left-wing colossus conspired to keep the information hidden from the American people. As Mary noted after the 2020 election, their collusion to bury the truth worked, Biden’s presidential campaign was not impacted by the revelations because voters either didn’t hear about them or believed them to be “Russian disinformation.”

Why did people think that it was Russian disinformation? Not only was the media hammering that point endlessly and Big Tech stifling the truth as “misinformation,” but 51 intelligence “experts” got together, penned a letter, and signed their names to willful propaganda that undermined the veracity of the emails at the root of the influence peddling controversy.

The New York Post reports:

> But the 51 former “intelligence” officials who cast doubt on The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop stories in a public letter really were just desperate to get Joe Biden elected president. And more than a year later, even after their Deep State sabotage has been shown again and again to be a lie, they refuse to own up to how they undermined an election.
> 
> The officials, including CNN pundit and professional fabricator James Clapper — a man who was nearly charged for perjury for lying to Congress — signed a letter saying that the laptop “has the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.”
> 
> What proof did they have? By their own admission, none. “We do not know if the emails … are genuine or not,” the letter said. They’re just “suspicious.” Why? Because they hurt Biden’s campaign, that’s evidence enough.

The media, of course, picked up where the, as the Post puts it, “spies who lie” left off with their vague “suspicions,” and took their baton to run ahead in the relay, pronouncing to all that the “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.” Except they didn’t. Not explicitly, not in that letter, anyway.  
This is why they are not apologizing.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div></figure>They didn’t lie. Not exactly. In fact, they explicitly stated that they have no evidence to support their conclusion; indeed, they admit they have no idea at all what they are talking about and aren’t basing it on anything other than their ‘experience’-based suspicions.

> We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement — just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></div></figure>The doubt these “intel officials” cast, though, was enough—as intended—for the partisan hacktavists in media to run with. Personally, I would have stopped taking the letter seriously at this paragraph, as would any thinking person.

From this carefully designed bit of propaganda successfully crafted to provide their media mouthpieces cover, the baton passed to Big Tech, who grasped it with glee and immediately began cancelling and deplatforming any person or entity, including the New York Post itself, for spreading this “Russian disinformation.”

Information that was all true and that every single one of these people from the very top to the lowliest editor at the least-clicked leftwing hackrag knew was true, but they were desperate to hide these bombshell revelations so that their preferred candidate, one they have strong evidence has been enriching himself and his family by peddling his position and influence for years to foreign entities, be elected president.

The left likes to wail about “Democracy” in peril, under threat, on the brink, but there is little that more imperils our Constitutional Republic than a cabal of powerful people colluding to influence elections by purposefully and willfully hiding the truth about candidates for the highest office in the land.
