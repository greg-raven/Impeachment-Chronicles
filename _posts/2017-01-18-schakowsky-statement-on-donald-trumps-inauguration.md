"I have decided to join the growing group of my colleagues who will not attend the Inauguration in protest of a President who used bigotry, fear, and lies to win an election that was tainted by foreign interference and voter suppression â€” and who intends to betray the interests of the ordinary working people who put him in office.

"On Saturday, I will join the Women's March on Washington and the many busloads of constituents who will be there to fight for the progressive agenda. My constituents and I are fired up in opposition to the Trump Agenda and are determined to not allow the Republicans to destroy the hard fought progress we've made."
