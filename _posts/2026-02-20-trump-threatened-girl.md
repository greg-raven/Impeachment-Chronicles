A witness swore under oath that Donald Trump threatened a young girl, warning she could "disappear like another 12-year-old" and saying he could have her family killed — according to Epstein-related court records.

That's sworn testimony. Not gossip. Not rumor.

Lying = federal prison.

So why is the DOJ scrubbing files instead of confronting this head-on?

Release everything.
