- Greenland is targets for impact campaigns to crack in relation to Denmark, the Police Intelligence Service informs.

The streets are covered with snow as an American man with close ties to US President and the White House lands in Nuuk.

The man is on a mission: During his visit he will draw up a list of names of Greenlandic citizens who support President Donald Trump's plans to take over Greenland.

The list must consist of Greenlanders who the American will try to recruit for a detachment movement across Greenland and Denmark.

The man is one of at least three americans with connections to Donald Trump, who performs secret impact operations in Greenland.

It assesses key sources of government and authority as well as sources in Greenland and the United States, with which DR has held several meetings since the deployment of Donald Trump as president in January this year.

It is the sources themselves that use words such as "infiltration" and "interaction operations" and believe that the goal of the operations is to penetrate the Greenlandic community to weaken relations with Denmark from the inside and make the Greenlanders submit to the United States.

History is based on information from eight sources which, due to the sensitive nature of the case, have commented on the condition of anonymity.

DR has not been able to clarify whether the American men work on their own initiative or on order.

- together worried about this. Of course we are, says a source of in-depth knowledge of the case of DR.

**See you often with Donald Trump**

During his visit to the snow-covered Nuuk earlier this year, the American man not only compiled a list of US-friendly Greenlanders in Greenland and Denmark.

He also collected names of people who oppose Donald Trump says a source.

The US man, who has been publicly seen with the US President many times, has recently been appointed a role to influence him on US security policy.

In Nuuk, according to a source, he also got Greenlanders to appoint cases that can be used to put Denmark in a bad light in American media.

Including stories of forced removal of Greenlandic children in Denmark and the so-called spiral case, where Danish doctors, without consent, placed spirals in Greenlandic girls and women.

- What we see is the use of soft power, influence and attempts to create internal divisions, says a source.

**Has worked under Trump**

Two other American men --- whose activities also concern the authorities --- have regularly traveled back and forth between Greenland and the United States in recent years.

Both men have previously worked under Donald Trump.

In Greenland, they have tried to nurture contacts with politicians, business people and citizens, and the concern of the sources is that these contacts can be used secretly to support Donald Trump's desire to take over Greenland.

For source reasons, DR cannot provide concrete details of what it is about the actions of the two men that concern the authorities.

'One way or another we get it', Donald Trump said about Greenland in March this year:

[...]

**PET: Greenland is targets for impact campaigns**

DR has asked the Police Intelligence Service (PET) for a comment on the activities of American men.

The intelligence service's response is that "a PET's assessment is that Greenland, especially in the current situation, is targets for various impact campaigns".

According to PET, the purpose of such campaigns will be to create divisions in the relationship between Greenland and Denmark:

- PET considers that this could be done by exploiting existing or inventive disagreements, for example in the case of known individual cases or by promoting or strengthening certain views in Greenland concerning the Kingdom and the United States or other countries with particular interest in Greenland.

The answer also shows that "PET is in ongoing and close dialogue with the Greenlandic authorities on the development of the threat picture of concrete impact activities and on the implementation of appropriate countermeasures".

The government has recently reported that PET will be more present in Greenland in the future.

**Fear silence before the storm**

According to a source, the American man who visited Nuuk earlier this year and made lists of Greenlanders continues to work to get Greenland incorporated into the United States.

Another source tells that some of the US activities in Greenland have run on a lower blouse over the summer, but that it is not necessarily a good thing:

- Maybe what we are currently experiencing is silence before the storm.

Greenland.

Denmark, which supports Trump's Greenland ambitions.

The revelation in the Wall Street Journal has reinforced the authorities' concern for an American threat to Greenlandic democracy, DR experiences.

**A strategy in three steps**

According to DR's information, the hidden activities in Greenland have been brought to the government.

According to a source, the assessment is that the Trump government's strategy to take over Greenland has been divided into three stages since Donald Trump announced in December 2024 that US "ownership and control over Greenland is an absolute necessity".

According to the source, the first phase was to direct a charm offensive to the Greenlanders --- including by sending President Donald Trump's son on a much-discussed visit to Nuuk in January.

Then came a phase of pressure on Denmark, where Vice President JD Vance, among other things, traveled to the US Pituffik base in Greenland in March this year and in a speech criticized Denmark for failing the Greenlanders.

In the spring, the strategy must then have entered a third phase, which is about infiltrating Greenlandic society.

Here, in the public, there was speculation as to whether the United States could come up using military power to take over Greenland --- spurred by Donald Trump himself having repeatedly wanted to rule out that possibility.

However, DR's sources do not believe that the United States is currently thinking of using military power to enforce an annexation.

'You haven't done your job well enough!', said the US Vice President during his visit to Greenland:

[...]

**A major political catache**

According to DR's information, the American influence attempts have put Denmark in a major policy dilemma, where all measures are weighed against a gold weight.

On the one hand, the Danish side would like to ensure that the Greenlanders are informed that American actors are secretly trying to influence the future of Greenlandic society.

On the other hand, Denmark will very much interfere in Greenland's internal conditions.

And in addition, the sources estimate that the activities of American men are in a legal gray zone where Greenland's special status complicates the matter.

- The Greenlanders may want to work for independence, and the United States may want to invest and work for stronger ties to Greenland, says a source.

But if the information in The Wall Street Journal holds --- and if US activities in Greenland were to be deleted from an intelligence service --- then the United States will have violated a clear limit, says the source:

- No one has to spy on --- the Americans either.

Land Government President Jens-Frederik Nielsen has repeatedly rejected that Greenland is for sale --- here at a press conference in April 2025:

[...]

**'The United States respects the right of the Greenlandic people'**

DR has asked the White House whether the US state has instructed US citizens to do impact operations in Greenland.

The White House has not answered.

The US Embassy in Copenhagen has sent a response from a representative of the US government. Here it sounds:

- Individual US citizens can have interests in Greenland.

The representative adds that the United States "Couds relations on the governments of Greenland and Denmark":

- The President, the Vice President, and the Foreign Minister have all been clear: The United States respects the right of the Greenlandic people to decide their own future.
