LOS ANGELES --- Joe Biden continued his attacks on President Trump after speaking at a union conference on Friday afternoon [September 19, 2019], calling the president "unhinged" and saying he was "concerned" over what Trump will do next.

"We gotta get something straight: All this talk from the president about corruption comes from the most corrupt president we've had in modern history. He's the definition of corruption," Biden said at the Unions for All Summit hosted by the Service Workers International Union in Los Angeles.

He added, "He's indicted himself by his own statements. This is not about me. It's not about my son. There's not a shred of evidence there's been anything done that was wrong."

"This is a guy that's unhinged," Biden also told reporters. "I worry about what he's going to do, not about me and my family. I'm worried about what he's going to do in the next year of his presidency."

House Democrats recently launched an impeachment inquiry into the president following concerns over his July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, during which he urged the foreign leader to investigate Biden, his potential 2020 general election opponent, and his son Hunter for corruption. Earlier this week, Trump called the inquiry a "coup."
