Schiff’s tweet two days after conspiring to obtain and leak classified information about @GenFlynn. It corroborates the staffer’s account and helps prove INTENT. The truth is that much of this kind of information never should have been classified in the first place. The Dem/IC/MSM alliance loves classifying everything so they can leak only the tidbits that drive their narrative and destroy the lives of their political foes, while the full truth in context remains hidden and tightly guarded for years.

> Real scandal here is @POTUS knew Flynn lied about Russian contacts and did nothing about it until the leak. Stop whining. #ActLikeAPresident
