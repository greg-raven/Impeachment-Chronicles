President Joe Biden said that former President Donald Trump was mentally unfit for office, in contrast with himself, Saturday night.

Biden, 81, attended the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner for the first time during his presidency. The dinner is known for its comedic atmosphere and the attendance of foreign heads of state, with Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar attending this year. Biden turned the focus of part of his speech to his own and Trump's, 77, mental acuity, saying that one candidate was too old and mentally unfit for the job.

"One candidate's too old and mentally unfit to be president," Biden said. "The other guy's me."

"Don't tell him, he thinks he's running against Barack Obama, that's what he said," Biden quipped.

The comments are the latest line of attack from Biden and his campaign to deflect criticism of Biden's mental acuity onto Trump. Biden has questioned Trump's mental acuity several times in the past in a less comedic manner, suggesting that it was actually the former president who was mentally unfit for office.

Aside from questioning his mental state, Biden hit Trump from other angles as well.

"Freedom is under assault. The freedom to vote, the freedom to choose, and so much more," he said. "The lies about the 2020 election, the plot to overturn it, to embrace the Jan. 6 insurrection pose the greatest threat to our democracy since the American Civil War. In 2020, they failed, but ... the threat remains."
