CIA Director John Ratcliffe: "They conspired against President Trump. They conspired against the American people ... The people behind this are STILL furthering the conspiracy."

[Partial transcript]

> Well, Maria, before the Intelligence Community Assessment that DNI Gabbard was talking about, and before Devon Nunes' report about that Intelligence Community Assessment, before the Mueller investigation, before Crossfire Hurricane there was this: In the summer of 2016, US intelligence intercepted Russian intelligence talking about a "Hillary Clinton plan" --- a Hillary Clinton plan to falsely accuse Donald Trump of Russia collusion, to vilify him and smear him with what would become known infamously ... as the "[Steele dossier]({% post_url 2016-06-20-the-steele-dossier %})." And, Maria, this intelligence was so explosive that John Brennan briefed President Obama, Vice President Biden, Jim Clapper, James Comey, the entire national security team, telling them about this Hillary Clinton plan.

> Again --- but think about this, Maria --- that was in August of 2016, and yet it wasn't until more than four years later, in October of 2020, when I found, after an exhaustive search, John Brennan's handwritten notes and the underlying intelligence behind it that revealed exactly what happened. So, for a four-year period of time, the truth about the origins of the Russia Collusion hoax was hidden from the American people. And unfortunately, Maria, as you recall, those same people were already, at that point in time, onto their next hoax, the Hunter Biden laptop. This was a month before the 2020 election, and unfortunately, what we saw with Joe Biden's ... election was another four years to be able to continue to bury the truth. And so, it's only now, with Donald Trump having been reelected, that --- through DNI Gabbard, myself, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel ‚Äî all of this intelligence, all of this evidence that's been hidden and buried from the American people is finally coming to light.

> There is no doubt in my mind that the people that we just talked about conspired. They conspired against President Trump; they conspired against the American people. And so, I'll leave it to Pam Bondi and our Department of Justice, Kash Patel, and our FBI to investigate the conspiracy to do what? And what charges that they're capable of bringing. But again, I don't think statute of limitations are going to impact because in a conspiracy, Maria, the statute of limitation doesn't start to run until the last act in furtherance of that conspiracy. And, Maria, part of why this is so important is the people behind this are still furthering the conspiracy --- they're refusing ... to admit or acknowledge what they did in 2016 and what they did in 2020 was wrong. And so, I think that's why this is so important, and why I'm excited about what the American people will see very shortly and what's to continue to come.
