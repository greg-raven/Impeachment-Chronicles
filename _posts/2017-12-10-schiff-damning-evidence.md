Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday the evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia is "pretty damning."

"The Russians offered help. The campaign accepted help. The Russians gave help. And the president made full use of that help," Schiff said during an interview on CNN's "State of the Union."

"And that's pretty damning, whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not," he continued.

Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a probe into possible Russian election hacking, said people need to look at the "pattern of chronology."

"You have, in late April, the Russians approaching the Trump campaign and saying, 'we have stolen Hillary Clinton emails,' " he said.

"You have only weeks later the Russians making another approach to the campaign, this time at the highest levels, offering dirt on Hillary Clinton."

He also mentioned other communications, including Donald Trump Jr.'s communications with WikiLeaks.

"So, we have all these facts in chronology. You would have to believe that these were all isolated incidents, not connected to each other. It just doesn't make rational sense," Schiff said.

"Now, 'can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt' will be Mueller's question to answer that the Russians communicated to the campaign that the way they were going to deliver the help they offered --- and that the campaign accepted --- was not by handing the emails directly over to the campaign, but by publishing them." he added.

Schiff said that would be up to special counsel Robert Mueller.

There are currently multiple investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has repeatedly denied collusion between his campaign and Russia.
