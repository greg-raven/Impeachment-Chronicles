Biden campaign co-chair Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat, told CNN on Tuesday that voters who think they were better off during Donald Trump's presidency are suffering from "amnesia."

> MANU RAJU, CNN: Do you have concerns if he simply lays out a laundry list of things that he believes he has achieved in office that that will may not land well, given that a lot of voters are not happy with the job that he's done in office?
>
> REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR: You know, I think the President can do both things at the same time. I think it is really important for the American people to remember where we were four years ago, where we couldn't be together, where we had a president, Donald Trump, telling us to inject disinfectant, calling COVID a hoax, historic job losses, a catastrophic economy, and President Biden inherited that mess and has helped rebuild our economy.
>
> Yes, there's work to be done, but it is --- and which is why we're asking the American people to let President Biden finish the job through a second term. But I do think it is important to recognize that the President has helped bring manufacturing jobs to America. Reduced the cost of prescription drugs, more to be done. But he can do both.
>
> RAJU: But why do you think --- I mean, more voters think that Trump did a better job in office than Biden? Does that concern you?
>
> ESCOBAR: It does. I do think that people have amnesia. And as I've been talking to communities across the country for the campaign, especially Latino communities, I have reminded them that about what we experienced for four years under Trump, what Trump left the current president, President Biden with, but also what he's promising to do, which will raise their costs.
>
> RAJU: Why haven't the --- you know, the Biden team keep saying that when it's a contrast, people will start to recognize that, but it is a contrast and people are still, polls still showing Trump ahead.
>
> ESCOBAR: I hope that changes and we're working to change that.
>
> RAJU: Is the Biden team failed to deliver on these messages that you're hoping to deliver to voters?
>
> ESCOBAR: You know, Manu, we've known from the beginning that this was going to be a tough election. The country is really divided. We're seeing that. You know, I see that on a daily basis in Congress.
