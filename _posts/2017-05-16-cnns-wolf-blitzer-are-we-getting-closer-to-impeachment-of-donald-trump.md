CNN host Wolf Blitzer brought up the possibility of impeaching President Trump in an interview with Senator Angus King (I-Maine) Tuesday evening after a New York Times article alleged the president asked then-FBI Director Comey to end the FBI investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

The White House denies the report.

“If these allegations, Senator, are true are we getting closer and closer to the possibility of yet another impeachment process?” Blitzer asked.

“Reluctantly, Wolf, I have to say yes simply because obstruction of justice is such a serious offense,” King responded.
