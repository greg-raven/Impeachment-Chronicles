Jared Kushner's father paid a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, secretly recorded it, and then showed the video to his own sister for revenge & intimidation.

He got caught.

He admitted it.

He got convicted.

Trump pardoned him.

And today he made him our next Ambassador to France.

The worst people on the planet are being placed in positions of tremendous influence and power.

And it's fucking disgusting.
