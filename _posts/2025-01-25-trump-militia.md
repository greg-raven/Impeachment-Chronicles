Those who have been released have made their intentions clear. These are far right violent extremists who have engaged in political violence, now set free by the president of the United States and encouraged emboldened, inspired to not only fight on his behalf but to commit violence on his behalf. 

This is effectively a militia that Donald Trump has created to support his political wishes and his personal wishes, which are always overlapped with his political wishes. 

We are here today to emphasize a couple of things, and first and foremost is that Donald Trump's pardons are a complete abandonment of all of the men and women in law enforcement around this country.
