Keith Olbermann claimed that Russia invaded us and installed Trump. He said just because you didn't see it, doesn't mean it didn't happen.

We are still Americans. He is the American president. I agree he didn't get there quite legitimately. Uh ...

> **Olbermann:** I spoke to a group of Democrats and liberals last night in Florida, and half of them were, like this crowd, fired up and understanding --- we were invaded, is what it boils down to. Just because there was not blood on the streets. If ... if the Russians had come in with Cossacks and put him in, I think we would have had a different kind of reaction to it. That's the reaction we need now. What I saw last night was a lot of people hooting and hollering, correctly, and getting fired up, and going to resist this in every way possible, and other people going, "You really think it's that serious?" Yes! I do think it's that serious! It's the same thing. It's the point ... the point ... the point of a war, other than to gain territory, is to put the guy you want in charge of somebody else's country. And we're now only debating at this point, after the story in *The New York Times* yesterday how much the Russians decided our election.
