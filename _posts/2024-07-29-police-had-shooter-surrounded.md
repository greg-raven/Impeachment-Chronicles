Holy Shit

New footage from July 13th shows police had the building surrounded for over a minute before the shooter opened fire!!!

Why didn't they take Trump off stage?

Why didn't they get to the shooter faster?

WERE THEY ORDERED TO STAND DOWN?

Agents also already had texts about the suspicious person with a range finder from over an hour before.

The more evidence that comes out‚Ä¶ THE MORE IT LOOKS LIKE AN INSIDE JOB ‚ö†Ô∏è

No wonder Facebook and Google are trying to erase the entire event from history!
