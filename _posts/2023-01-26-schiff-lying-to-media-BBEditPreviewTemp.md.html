<p>On Wednesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy officially removed
Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) from the House Intelligence Committee,
prompting reporters from pro-Democrat CNN and MSNBC to scratch their
heads and question what on Earth could have motivated McCarthy to do
such a thing. Yet their theatrical protestations cannot change the fact
that Schiff is a well-documented purveyor of disinformation,
particularly with regard to the Donald Trump/Russia conspiracy
theory.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable to see a group of people who call themselves
“journalists” so aggressively defending a Congressman who strung them
along for more than three years with false promises and empty
assertions.</p>
<p>During the Trump years, Schiff was a favorite guest on both CNN and
MSNBC due to his penchant for promising that he had found “damning”
evidence that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russians during the
2016 election. For a look back at Schiff’s many lies from that period,
watch the video below:</p>
