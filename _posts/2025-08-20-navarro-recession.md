The *Wall Street Journal* has been waging war on Trump's tariffs since day one‚Äîpredicting a "Navarro Recession," runaway inflation, and economic collapse.

They've been WRONG every time.

Here are the top 5 myths they've pushed.

Let's SHATTER them.

**Myth #1** --- "Tariffs Are a Tax on Americans" --- The Myth the *WSJ* Doesn't Want to Let Die

The *WSJ* said prices would spike.

Reality: Exporters absorbed the tariffs. No sticker shock on Asian electronics and European autos.

**Myth #2** --- "Tariffs Create Chaos"

The *WSJ* confuses leverage with volatility.

It's true that it's not business as usual: America is WINNING now.

Tariffs forced deals that milquetoast diplomacy couldn't dream of:

- The EU agreed to cut industrial tariffs & open ag markets.

- Japan pledged $350 billion to rebuild U.S. supply chains.

- Korea's Hyundai/Kia investing billions in U.S. EV & battery plants.

**Myth #3** --- "Tariffs Hurt U.S. Industry"

The *WSJ* focused on short-term input costs, while ignoring industry resurgence:

- Steel mills expanding in OH, AR, and KY.

- Rare earth & magnet plants in TX and CA.

- Pharma plants boosting U.S. drug production.

- New aerospace & defense capacity.

This is a MANUFACTURING RENAISSANCE.

**Myth #4** --- "Tariffs Cause Stagflation."

The *WSJ* tried to make "stagflation" a thing in 2018 and 2019.

Now they're trying again in 2025.

The reality? Despite their hopes for the sky to fall, growth is steady, inflation is under control.

The real risk is foreign dependency --- exactly what tariffs fix.

**Myth #5** --- "Free Trade Is Always Best."

üö®The *Wall Street Journal* serves Wall Street, not Main Street.

Multinational corporations love "free trade" because it maximizes profit. They LOVE open borders, Asian sweat shops and couldn't care less about American workers ...

Donald Trump fights for good jobs, strong industries, and national security right here at home.

Even by Wall Street's own metrics, tariffs ARE working:

- Markets are up.

- Corporate profits are solid.

- No inflation surge.

Main Street wins with jobs & factories. Wall Street still profits. The only losers? The *WSJ* and its credibility.

Here's the bottom line: *WSJ*'s editorial board is stuck in 1990s "free trade" over "fair trade" dogma.

President Trump's tariffs are rebuilding America's industrial base, delivering for the American worker, and proving the "Navarro Recession" crowd-who-cried-wolf wrong --- again.

How do you like them apples?
