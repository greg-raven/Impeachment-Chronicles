Recent polling has us effectively tied in the seven battleground states --- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina --- with a small advantage in some and a small but surmountable deficit in others.

That makes the threat of Donald Trump and JD Vanceâ€™s extreme Project 2025 agenda very real. If they win, they will roll back our freedoms, hurt the middle class, and threaten our democracy.
