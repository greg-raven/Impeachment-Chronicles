Former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes, who currently serves as Chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, on Sunday described the Russia collusion hoax as an "ongoing conspiracy" against Donald Trump and against the American people, and said that Donald Trump's plan to clean up the FBI and the Department of Justice includes "accountability for the people who perpetuated this ongoing hoax."

Speaking with Maria Bartiromo on "Sunday Morning Futures," Nunes said:

> It's important to remember that this is an ongoing conspiracy. It hasn't stopped, and the people that have hoisted this on the American people for the last decade have never paid one price, and they're continuing to do exactly the same thing that they have done for awhile.

Nunes contends that there is an ongoing hoax/scheme that started with the Russia collusion story, continued with "the fake whistleblower on Ukraine and the impeachment," then the 51 Spies Who Lied about the Hunter Biden laptop being Russian disinformation, continued with the raid on Mar-a-Lago, and continues today.

> [P]robably the biggest thing that still needs to be researched and the information needs to be put out to the American public is this: Why was there a raid at Mar-a-Lago? What led to that raid? What led to the appointment of that special counsel? What the hell were they doing at Mar-a-Lago? What were they looking for? This was an unprecedented act in US history where the Department of Justice raids a former president's home.

> That was an attempt --- whatever they were looking for, whatever scheme they had cooked up --- whatever they were looking for they didn't find, clearly. But that was to try to stop President Trump from being reelected.

Nunes didn't give specific examples of how this conspiracy is still being carried out today, but one possibility is Saturday's "exclusive" at NBC News from Susan Miller, a retired CIA officer who was one of the lead officers for the 2017 intelligence report about Russia's actions during the 2016 election. Miller accused Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard of "lying" and following a script from Donald Trump:

> "The director of national intelligence and the White House are lying, again," Miller said. "We definitely had the intel to show with high probability that the specific goal of the Russians was to get Trump elected."

Miller also acknowledged that there was zero evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russians or that Russia's alleged efforts even had an effect.

Current CIA Director John Ratcliffe, also appearing on "Sunday Morning Futures," also spoke of an ongoing conspiracy and how that would impact potential prosecutions:

> There is no doubt in my mind that the people that we just talked about conspired. They conspired against President Trump; they conspired against the American people.

> "But again, I don't think statutes of limitations are going to impact because, in a conspiracy, Maria, the statute of limitations doesn't start to run until the last act in furtherance of that conspiracy. And, Maria, part of why this is so important is the people behind this are still furthering the conspiracy.
