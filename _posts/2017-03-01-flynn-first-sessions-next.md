Flynn was the first obstacle who had to be overcome. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was the next. The Trump loyalist with a strong Department of Justice background would also need to be briefed on the anti-Trump efforts unless he could be sidelined. Comey admitted that early in Sessions' tenure, he deliberately hid Russia-related information from Sessions because, "it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigations." To secure that recusal, yet another leak was deployed to the Washington Post's Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller. The leak was intended to tar Sessions as a secret Russian agent and was dramatically spun as "Sessions Spoke Twice To Russian Envoy: Revelation contradicts his testimony at confirmation hearing." One meeting was in passing and the other was in his function as a United States Senator, but the hysteria was such that the Post authors could get away with suggesting Sessions was too compromised to oversee the Department of Justice's counterintelligence operations involving Russia. It is perhaps worth noting that the Special Counsel idea was pushed in this article.
