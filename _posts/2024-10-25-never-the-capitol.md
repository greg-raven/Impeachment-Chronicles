Way down at the bottom of the "bombshell" Rolling Stone article about Jan 6 they admit that all the evidence shows planners were talking about the vote in Congress and no one even discussed marching on the Capitol

> Heading into Jan. 6, both sources say, the plan they had discussed with other organizers, Trump allies, and members of Congress was a rally that would solely take place at the Ellipse, where speakers --- including the former president --- would present "evidence" about issues with the election. This demonstration would take place in conjunction with objections that were being made by Trump allies during the certification on the House floor that day.

> "It was in a variety of calls, some with Gosar and Gosar's team, some with
Marjorie Taylor Greene and her team ... Mo Brooks," the organizer says.
