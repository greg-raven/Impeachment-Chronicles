- Durham began investigating origins of Crossfire Hurricane in 2019

Special Counsel John Durham found that the Department of Justice and FBI "failed to uphold their mission of strict fidelity to the law" when it launched the Trump-Russia investigation.

Fox News Digital obtained Durham's report Monday afternoon after his years-long investigation into the origins of the FBI's original investigation, known as "[Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %})." That investigation looked into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.

Durham gave his final report to the Justice Department, which released it Monday afternoon. The report spans more than 300 pages.

"Based on the review of [Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %}) and related intelligence activities, we conclude that the Department and the FBI failed to uphold their mission of strict fidelity to the law in connection with certain events and activities described in this report," the report said.

Durham said his investigation also revealed that "senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor towards the information that they received, especially information received from politically-affiliated persons and entities."

"This information in part triggered and sustained [Crossfire Hurricane]({% post_url 2016-07-31-crossfire-hurricane %}) and contributed to the subsequent need for Special Counsel Mueller's investigation," the report said. "In particular, there was significant reliance on investigative leads provided or funded (directly or indirectly) by Trump's political opponents."

"The Department did not adequately examine or question these materials and the motivations of those providing them, even when at about the same time the Director of the FBI and others learned of significant and potentially contrary intelligence," the report said.

Durham is referring to past FBI leadership in his report – specifically former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.
