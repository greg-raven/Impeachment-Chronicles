NO ONE HELD TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE

When Trump spread lies about a stolen election, no one held him accountable.

When his followers attacked the Capitol, no one held him accountable.

When he assembled teams of fake electors and pressured state officials to break election laws, no one held him accountable.

When he stole classified documents, no one held him accountable.

When he threatened to prosecute and use the military against his political opponents and revoke the licenses of TV stations, no one held him accountable.

Even when he was convicted of 34 felonies, no one held him accountable.

And that's why we have a fascist and a criminal headed for the White House ---

BECAUSE NOBODY HELD DONALD TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE.
